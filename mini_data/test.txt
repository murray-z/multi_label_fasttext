Hi RedRose and apologies for delay. Here is a draft of what I propose to present on the 'new section' pages.The 6 volumes of Ultimate Allocations cover the 'reported' allocations of all British Railways: Steam  Diesel & Electric Locomotives on BR stock from 1950 - 1968 with additional information from 1948 where available. They are formatted in A4 comb bound volumes for ease of use. There are 3 main columns which are sub-divided with individual locomotive details including date when 'new' if appropriate. All 'reported' and published allocations and re-allocations combined with withdrawal dates where known are listed on either 'Weekly' - 'Monthly' - or 'Period Ending' dependant on regional variations at that time. A link to several testimonials and scanned images type of information provided can be found at www.ultimate-allocations.co.ukPlease advise if this information would be acceptable for presentation in the 'new section' you previously advised. I look forward to seeing your reply and thank you once again for your assistance in this matter.Mike McManus.  Mike61680	0|0|0|0|0|0

" ""Islamofascism"" The term ""Islamofascism"" is (in my opinion, intentionally) inflammatory, in addition to being generally inaccurate (as fundamentalist Islam shares very few traits with World-War-II-era fascism).

Vandalizing the Macedonian towns Glenn, first of all the Freestylefrappe is not TERSELY saying, he has already blocked me without any warning. Have you seen his version of Kumanovo article? He is talking only about murdering, blood, terrorism and nothing about the city normal life. Of course, there were moments in the Kumanovo’s history when a terrorist attacks took place, but Kumanovo is most of the time a quiet ordinary Macedonian town that doesn’t deserve such descriptions.  It is the same as if you write an article about London not mentioning St Paul’s catedral, Westminster, Tower bridge.. and writing only about recent terrorist attacks in the London underground. Talking about copyvios, I noticed that FreeStyleFrappe is using text written by Christopher Deliso You can check that on:http://www.serbianna.com/columns/deliso/http://www.popovashapka.com/terrorist_bombing_in_kumanovo.htmAre you sure he has permit for doing that?

Winston ChurchillIn her autobiography, Barrymore makes no mention of a marriage proposal from Churchill to her. She writes many times of their close friendship, but that is all. Seeing as she has been very forthcoming as to her personal life, and yet ignores a so-called marriage proposal from WC, I feel it was best to remove that item from her Wiki and instead mention the friendship. Unless a crediable source for such a proposal can be quoted to the satisfaction of all concerned, I believe the current edit should remain as is.Also, as to her meeting her husband, I removed what was there and used her own memoir as the source for how they met.	0|0|0|0|0|0

The statement about Scott's refusal comes from the 1911 Britannica article, and the evaluation there does sound rather negative and some other points of view would be useful, and indeed another has been added, but the Hayley quote would be an interesting addition as well if you have a source (book, article, authoritative web page) for it.  Advice on making your additions:  provide a verifiable citation for statements you make following the examples already in the article.  If you don't have a verifiable citation, it is probably best to leave the statement here on the talk page until one is found.  You may have to do minor edits to the other text to make your new text fit in.  Do your best, but if it's not perfect I'm sure someone else will give their attention to it at some point.  Don't let imperfection prevent a verifiable addition that is worthwhile in your eyes.  Look at the Help pages for more advice.	0|0|0|0|0|0

" 2014 (UTC)CommentsThis is the first article I nominate to GA-review, please tell me if I miss anything. walk victor falk talk What about those taken prisoner by the British/Allies in the Middle East. Also those who refused to join the Free French in Britain and were repatriated back to France.?   I respect this point, but we're talking about close on two million people in prisoner of war camps in Germany. That's what the scholarship covers and it's that which is covered by reliable sources establishing notability. Everything else, a tiny fraction by comparison, is generally only mentioned as a footnote to a general history of the campaign. Yes, French soldiers were probably taken prisoner from Indochina to Britain, North Africa to the Middle East. But they pale into insignificance when compared with the 2 million in Germany and this is why all the titles on the bibliography talk about French prisoners but only deal with the German-held ones. So I see your point, but I can't really do anything about it. It just isn't out there. '    Yesterday I was editing Free_France#Syria_and_East_Africa, and as it mentioned how only 5000 out of 40000 chose to join Free France while the rest wanted to be rapatriated, my immediate spontaneous/instinctive reaction was to wish for something like [[French WWII POWs#Vichy prisoners]] to target in this article. However, as  notes, some probably existed but their numbers are vanishlingly small and the result of special circumstances, such as beeing spies, obvious traitors & collaborators and suchlike that does not fall in what is considered a POW by international conventions; For the allies, rank and file Vichy troops were always offered a choice of repatriation, no questions asked, and their incarceration as POWs always a temporary affair.  I can think that more conventional perhaps such existed as Axis and especially Japanese ones after the coup in March 1945 eliminated any fiction of Vichy rule in Indochina, but sources about that might be very elusive to find; and anyway, probably more within the scope of the ""POWs held by the Japanese"" wikipedia article. At the most, a short sentence summarising the above might be added somewhere, to dispell the same curiosity from readers that you've shown. walk victor falk talk  Reviewer seems to be active on Wikipedia but has not done anything to this review in almost 2 weeks.

" Unprotected I'm going to edit based on my comments in Talk:New_anti-Semitism#Sourcing_claims_for_.22Country-specific_incidents so could we discuss them now?  All the incidents mentioned are regarded as examples of the new anti-Semitism i.e. coming from the left, related to radical anti-Zionism etc.  (talk) They may well be, but they are not sourced that way.  I don't think we can expect the words ""new anti-Semitism"" to appear in every single report we reference. We've defined it, and we've linked to many sources who are defining it. The definition is:It is a form of Judenhass that emanates from the left. It is characterized by the demonization of the world's only Jewish state and of Jews as an ethnicity and a religion. Israel's right to exist as an equal member of the world community is denied. The Jewish people's right of self-determination is denied. Double standards are applied, whereby the actions of the Jewish state are judged according to a different standard from the actions of all the neighboring states around her. Jews as a people are held collectively responsible for the actions of the Jewish state. Symbols and images associated with classic anti-Semitism are used: for example, blood libels are resurrected, the Jewish state and Jewish people are associated with wild conspiracy theories involving Jews or Zionists or Israelis plotting to take over the world, or being in control of other governments, or being responsible behind the scenes for various acts of terror mistakenly attributed to others. Arab and Islamic anti-Semitism are excused and ignored. Straw-man attacks are made, whereby Jews are alleged to claim that any criticism of Israel is anti-Semitism, and that is then used to condemn Jewish groups as unreasonable, and to deny that there is any such thing as the ""new anti-Semitism."" All of the above is accompanied by an international resurgence of violence against Jews and their synagogues and schools, particularly in Europe. It is found in conjunction with anti-Americanism (because Jews are believed either to control or be too influential with the American government), anti-Zionism, and the anti-globalization movement.All the authoritative sources who have written about the phenomenon agree that these are the key components, so when we find them, we can offer them as examples, so long as someone has discussed them in terms of anti-Semitism or attacks on Jews.  (talk) My worry is that Livingstone has not been (at least in the sources provided) accused of anti-semitism, and that most of the discussion of Galloway has nothing to do with the allegation of anti-semitism against his supporters.  Add to that that we appear to be accusing them of anti-semitism (not reporting others allegations), which is OR (and unwise in the case of Galloway).  The NUS thing is a bit ephemeral but has been discussed in terms of new anti-semitism so I'd just want to tidy that up.  Livingstone has very definitely been accused of anti-Semitism (got into quite a bit of trouble recently over it), as has Galloway, and without question his supporters. The section talks about it in relation to that election. By all means go ahead and clean it up as you see fit, and we can talk later if there are any disagreements.  (talk) Slim, whose definition is this?   All the sources put together. The above are the issues they agree on. It was posted weeks ago.  (talk) I think you mean ""all the sources from one side of the argument put together"".  It's been a while since we discussed this, so could you remind me as to which sources you consider authoritative?   Sorry, you'll have to look in the archives; they're either there or in the article. By ""all the sources,"" I mean all the sources who study new anti-Semitism. The above are the elements they appear to agree on.  (talk) I'm asking you which sources you consider to be authoritative.

"Why did you delete the one source that we've been talking the most about? Why do you want to hide the truth from readers? The concepts of qi and meridians are very contentious, because they don't exist from a reductionist, disectionist, Western medical science point of view. Do you want to know what meridians are? Every type of tissue, muscle fiber, etc, is wrapped up and enclosed in fascia. Meridians are the spaces in between these fascia, you are never going to ""find"" them by cutting bodies apart and looking at them in a microscope. They are the nothingness that provides function, as in verse 11 of the Tao Te Ching ""Thirty spokes convergeIn the hub of a wheel;But the use of the cartWill depend on the partOn the hub that is void.With a wall all aroundA clay bowl is molded;But the use of the bowlWill depend on the partOf the bowl that is void.Cut out windows and doorsIn the house as you build;But the use of the houseWill depend on the spaceIn the walls that is voidSo advantage is hadFrom whatever is there;But usefulness arisesFrom what is not.""These interfascial spaces have increased salt concentrations and thus increased electro-conductivity properties, and it is the manipulation of the bioelectrochemical energy (i.e. ""qi"") in these spaces which acupuncture seeks to accomplish.Now yes, this is original research on my behalf, and cannot be included in the text.

" Mormonism and history merge proposal Storm, I saw your note on Trodel's page and wanted to touch base.  I am definately against merging, primarily because placing the topic in History of the Latter Day Saint movement reduces it to a ""one time"" issue.  The most recent pattern of ""faith-promoting"" history was (as a BYU trained historian, I sincerely hope) a one time event.  But Mormonism and history is a much bigger topic, closer to historiography, having implications from Joseph's time to the present.  I don't know if this is the right title for such an article, but we are having a restructuring discussion on the Mormonism and history page.  Please drop in and give your two cents.

"Hello again, Tdadamemd. Getting right to your comment about slang, I don't understand your stating that ""fuck"" is not slang, or your linking to dictionary.com as proof that it is not. The word ""fuck,"" while vulgar, is also slang; the dictionary.com source you cited even states so. It makes it clear that it can be slang for a variety of things, including sexual intercourse/other sexual activity. It list 13 numbered examples regarding what ""fuck"" can mean. As for Wiktionary, I don't refer to sources like that. And, yes, I am fine with mentioning ""fuck"" (or ""fucking"") and the euphemism ""sleeping together"" lower in the article, in the the Definitions and stimulation factors section, as alternative words for sexual intercourse/sexual activity. But again, there are a lot of terms for sexual intercourse, most of them slang. That these terms exist doesn't mean that all of them should be in this article. In fact, most times when there are many alternative terms for a word, especially if those terms are slang, we don't include all of them. As you know, this is an encyclopedia and not a dictionary. If WP:CONSENSUS is achieved for including your proposal, I'll add it by briefly summarizing that there are various vulgar and/or slang terms and euphemisms for sexual intercourse/other sexual activity...such as ""fuck"" and ""sleeping together"" (the wording won't be exactly like that, of course). And, really, because there are so many terms for sexual intercourse, and ""fuck"" is not especially relevant to the topic of sexual intercourse (by that, I mean that most people and sources are not discussing the word ""fuck"" when discussing sexual intercourse), that is probably why ""fuck"" isn't currently in this article. Someone who is aware of your having repeatedly added it to the lead expressed to me via email me that ""fuck"" is also U.S.-centric; so that's also something to think about, though the term is also used outside of the United States. Also, sexual intercourse does not = fuck. It's that fuck = sexual intercourse; in its literal sense anyway, since when people use the term...they are usually using it as profanity. That is also why I told you ""The Fuck article mentions sexual intercourse in its lead because it is especially relevant to the topic. However, the term 'fuck' is not especially relevant to the topic of sexual intercourse."" I cannot see how this article is broken simply because it doesn't currently include ""fuck."" But, like I stated, I don't mind adding it to the article. I'd rather see what others have to state on that matter first, however.   "	1|0|1|0|0|0

I feel this has been a fortuitous day, as if our Universe has conspired to have us meet. ;)As you have an interest in this topic, perhaps you can translate some of the material from our own Pandeism page to its rather sparse Romanian counterpart. Sadly, our own article has recently been the recipient of an exclusionist hatchet job, which included (as part of the harsh medicine imposed) the separation of the article into Pandeism and God becomes the Universe. But the material in the later article is obviously still about Pandeism, and ought to be included in an article honestly addressing that topic. Blessings!!	0|0|0|0|0|0

"==Name==I've been studying Satmar for a good bit, and I've been to Kiryas Joel. I've never heard it called ""Sakmer"". Are we sure about this?  I've been around many Hasidim for a long, long time too, and I have never heard of Sakmer either, so it may just be baloney and that word should be removed.  there is a street in KJ called Sakmeralso: look at this http://tovrent.com/satmar/85.jpgThe reason some call it Sakmer is because the name Satmer is based on Satu Mare which remotely referes Saint Mary [NOTE - not true, Satu Mare means simply ""Large Village"" in Romanian!]. Hassidic Jews have always refrained from sanctifying Christian saints and therefore have created alternative names for quite a few cities. Izak love, when you don't know something, that does not make it balony.   PS, I haven't been ""studying"" Satmer - I am one, and my maternal grandfather referes to his birthplace as Sakmer (AKA Satu Mare). PPS There is no KJ street called Sakmer. The photo you attached clearly dubbs the Satmar Rabbi ""The Rav of Sakmer"". For those who study Satmer but have no knowledge of the script which the Satmers use, the word is the one at the lower left corner looking something like this: סאקמער. The third letter from the right carries the K sound. Cheers.I recently heard in regular chatting from an acquaintence that an ancestor (great-grandfather?) of his called Satmar Sakmer. Why do they not utilize that term anymore? And, I'm done with my hardcore pshat study of different Hasidic groups.  It's total nonsense, the 'saint mary' story. Satu Mare means 'large town'. My father has been there many times. Wikipedia (yes yes) also says that Satu Mare means 'large town', and that 'saint mary' is something else entirely in Hungarian/Romanian.  I revised the opening paragraph by indicating the Satmars are one of the largest hasidic groups - it is widely thought there are about 200,000 Lubavitchers, but since none of the hasidic groups keeps a formal membership role, this is all conjecture - it would be incorrect for any group to claim they are the largest, there is no way of knowing. About Satmar and NETUREI KARTA. THe Cherem bit is incorrect, as is the bit of a denunciation. Also the part of asking Reb Yoilish to meet with Yasser Arrafat. It's all myth. Yasser Arafat and the PLO were not the public face of the Palestinian cause before Reb Yoilish had his stroke, so it doesn't make sense. I actually asked a chaver of the Satmar Beis Din about the Cherem, and he said it's nonsense. The Beis DIn has not publicly issued a cherem against a person or group of people since its formation in the United States. No denunciation was issued either. It's a made up propaganda piece by the Kakhnik radio station Arutz Sheva. It never happened. No such thing ever appeared in Der Yid, which is the official newspaper.  Good editGood recent edit, IZAK. ¸,ø¤º°`°º¤ø,¸¸,ø¤º°`°º¤ø,¸ 5 July 2005 23:56 (UTC) Etymology with Satu coming from the same root as ""city"" (civitas)Actually, it's not like this. In Romanian, ""satu"" is derived from Latin ""fossatum"" and it originally meant a village encircled by a moat (in Latin ""fossa""). ""Cetate"" is the Romanian word derived from ""civitas"".  | Talk NPOVPeople have mistaken this article to be a fork of HydePark.co.il. It is not.

Ok, first of all, any person who read what I put up would have known (if they can erd english properly) what I stated. I am a son of Arjun. You clearly aren't, so will never have the affinity for him that I do, my blood tie goes one step beyond your religious pride in him, which incidentally I DO RESPECT. I am not Hindu, correct. But Shiv for some strange ill infomed reason tried to state that Arjun was not a first cousin to Krishna, which is historically incorrect. I EVEN GAVE LINKS TO HIM TO CLEAR IT UP, but he is sadly so illiterate (sadly like the rest of you) to understand it then, misinterpret it TODAY. I dont believe Arjun was a God, you may do, and I respect that. How this is provoking anything against 'Prophets' or my 'Muslim brothers' when I have said nothing gainst your 'Gods' r your 'Hindu brothers' is beyond my understanding. I think Dab maybe true in calling you 12yr old trolls. But anyway, no there is a massive difference in Rajputs, this page proves it.

Well there's only one thing for it, isn't there? Do try this at home (aka OR). ) Funny I never tried this before. I just filled a condom (Chess, a cheap brand) with about three liters of water and it held. I didn't dare pick it up solely with the 'end' (what should I cal that?), for fear of breaking it, and it's night now, so I'll do more outdoor experimenting tomorrow. But I could pick it up while supporting the bottom. A bit wobbly, but no problem. Of course condoms have to be of quite good quality, for their orginal purpose. I havent tried drinking the water yet, though. Shoud be ok though, because the spermicide is on the outside only. And I don't know where I might get condoms without spermicide. I'll be visiting my outdoor store, Demmenie, one of these days, and then I'll ask. This much handling causes sticky hands, though. And hard to wash oof too. Normally I only handle condoms lightly with my finger tips. But more experimental info tomorrow.	0|0|0|0|0|0

"Licinius, the more you explain your position, the more I think you're reading something into the current wording that just plain isn't there. Saying Aussie Rules is an Australian variety of football does not say that it is more Australian than ""gridiron"" (NFL is the competition, not the game!) is American. It doesn't say that Australians haven't had great influence on rugby league. The descriptions of the sections don't need to be, and in fact shouldn't be in the same format, since the different groups are not exactly the same sort of groups. The different codes are grouped into sections based on their history and similarities between the codes. There are two very obvious big groups, both easily characterised by their ""ancestry"" - the kicking games descended from association rules and the carrying games descended from the rugby rules. The rest of the codes, all relatively minor in global terms, cannot be characterised by a single ancestry, and so shouldn't be. They are a group of games, some influenced by both soccer-type games and rugby school rules, with various influences within the group as well, that are most easily characterised by the fact that they are all Australian or Irish in origin. Saying some of them are Australian varieties of football is not saying the rugby codes are  ""unAustralian"" any more than calling Gaelic football an Irish variety implies that Irish soccer players are not Irish/Gaelic!

Hi. Re: ɰ /ɰ/ is equivalent to what some write as /w/ and orthographically as . This sound is not phonetically [w] because it does not have lip rounding, so some folks (including me) feel that <ɰ> is a more appropriate symbol.  was useful because it was found on typewriters while <ɰ> had to be written in by hand.  Computers are getting better at displaying this stuff, so I say use the more accurate symbol. [ç] is different in that there is audible frication and the constriction is further forward in the mouth. [ç] is an allophone of /h/, but [ɰ] is not. Actually, [ɰ] is redundant since it is just a short [ɯ] (like [j] is a short [i] and [w] is a short [u]) — we could just use a non-syllabic diacritic. Re: (j) (j) is supposed to mean /j/.  It doesnt include /ɰ/ — C+/ɰ/+V is not allowed. In other words, Japanese allows an optional /j/ before a vowel and following an optional consonant onset, i.e. V or /j/+V or C+V or C+/j/+V. -  09:52, 2005 Feb 7 (UTC)	0|0|0|0|0|0

" Background section At the present time, the ""background"" section cites unspecified interviews with the media, according to which, Ahmed claimed to ""take apart a clock and rebuild it inside a pencil case.""The sentence is taken verbatim from the NPR article. However, it links to a Dallas News article, which says no such thing, to a Dallas News interview, which also does not contain this statement, and mentions a WFAA interview, which I've been unable to find. I've checked four different interviews with Ahmed and he does not explicitly describe it as a rebuilt clock in any of them.If such an interview exists and the statement was not an interpolation by NPR, it would be nice to have a direct link, a quote and a date.The problem with the statement is that it provides inadequate background for the rest of the article. When the story broke on 9/15, the device was consistently described by the media as ""a homemade clock"" or ""an invention"".  The fact that it was a reassembled commercial clock was mentioned in passing by a WFAA article (which quoted Irving police) on 9/16 but otherwise mostly ignored. It only went ""viral"", so to speak, when Dawkins waded into the controversy on 9/20 and his comments got picked up by the conservative media.Much of the immediate reaction, from Obama's tweet and Zuckerberg's invitation to Dawkins' lashing out, seems inexplicable if the device in question was acknowledged to be a rebuilt commercial clock from day 1, but makes sense if the device was initially assumed by everyone to be a genuine homemade clock.

I still think ""Land of the Morning Calm"" should be removed from the intro, as it has a boastful tone, Korea's not widely known by this name except among Koreans, and it's a misnomer as Korea is not a quiet country. An analogy: the article on the United States doesn't say ""Also known as the Land of the Free"". Some terms such as ""full democracy"" are also not widely used in English.

You're mixing apples and oranges: historical scholarship is not required for Wikipedia to add information, say, on a claim to the Bosnian throne. (Sorry no one has claimed the Croatia's yet). To add that information to the list of many other claimants around the world does not require approval from the pope, but it does reqire that the claimant has (A) in fact made the claim, and that (B) news sources reported on it that are considered respectable in that country.  Since the news source we're talking about here are online, Alexa is the criterion for their as any other online ranking of news portals because their high position in Alexa means high readership. In the news business, this is how you measure success. The sources that reported on the claim are not tabloids but conventional news portals, as anyone can see: www.source.ba, www.bljesak.info, etc. Please be respectful, others have brains and eyes too and stop the edit war.   Thanks for the diagram. If you look at it closely, you'll realize you're not even attempting to compromise, meaning you're the one not following WP:EDITCONSENSUS. Instead, you keep making total reverts canceling entire edits (which took hours of someone's valuable time) without ever discussing it in Talk. By being so obviously rude, you also remove dozens of reliable references such as in Ban Borić article where your remove all history ebooks from the Google Scanning project with a single hit of a button.

You failed to do any iof it.I idn't receive any messages from you not even after you had banish me, yhought your message above is dated of the 26 of august it wasn't there at that date and I am sure of it. I didn't have acces to anything that day.About the things I edit, they are of the most relevant kind to what is sayed ont this site.All pseudo subbjects are all lies as the Bogdanovs have alredy answered all those points in different places of the web, inclusiv wiki, at different times, for the past 2 years.For 13 days ago there was absolutely nothing more to discuss about, and seeing that, YBM used his ususal tactic who is to do as if they din't have answered the questions at hand, and that way, confuse the other users and make them believe that it was the case, as he has always done since 2003.Someone has to stand up and say it, someone has to put an end to this circus, and I choose to do so.I do not have followed the story from the beginning and do not know the Bogdanov but through this affair, that I begin to interest myself with since the beginning og august.Two things became clear for me as I scanned all the web on the subjects: YBM was the person doing all the staging, and YBM didn't knew what he was talking about. I also found out that no matter how many times and in how many languages and by how many specialists the answers were given to him, he will keep asking and accusing peoples, and agress them personnally and accuse them of not being edicated in that field or critisized their university or making threat at contacting their chiefs, and even insult them to push them away from the discussion platform, as this kind of people represented a real threat to his status.And of course, especially when we are talking of the scientific platform like in fr. physic or scent physic, those people, phd or professor at university were not used at being roll around with nor being talking to that way and even less at being insulted and confronted with non argumentativ methods.So they left and never show up again, leeving all free room that YBM could ever wish for to pursue his goal.But what was this goal exactly?It wasn't the truth as he kept lying and had been given all answers, and was often denying to have done certain things who were appearing very often.He was repeating himself and soon I saw a pattern emerging, from all his apparitions on the web, with falsh accusations, lies, home made stories, fantasyfull evidences, links to web sites from his own making, agression, personal attacs, insults.His goal was not at all to discuss science but to manipulate others and he managed to do so very well as he was allowed to fool so many for such a long time. T>wo years is a very long time for a little subject as this one.Then I was contacted by people who had been confronted to him, prior to this case, and had been subject to the same attacks and methods on the web.I stude it, and saw worse than I could ever imagined. It was all planed from the beginning and a part of an ideologie with filosofical pretenses on how one could manipulate other people meaning by creating a situation on line.It is what they call Post situationism, and wich is issued of Voyer. In the previous case against a teacher that he knew from school and a women writer (on cooking books!) he had just met Voyer but been found of him for a longer time, by the beginning of Bogdanovs affair he had been introduce inside the rangs of Voyer and Co, and as the affair progressed assured himself a high status in this ""confrerie"".That is the reason why this article I come with is of such importance. It reveal what was behind all along, what motivated the principal actors of this mascarade, and show all that they have been manipulated from the beginning and still are.There is no Bogdanov affair, it is an illusion, a part from a group of ideologs making a thinking experiment and giving life to it by means of the internet.Brillant! Unless there was casualties.And there is.Plenty of, and more than the Bogdanovs private sphere and their career.I was really aroused from the beginning when I realised what YBM was about but even more when I saw what it all was really about, I was shocked by how unpropper and unethical it all was, and what a big unjustice it was to all who were involved in it, and this also include people who have followed and defended the apparent vews of YBM not kn	0|0|0|0|0|0
DID CHRISTIANS INVENT SATAN.The idea that Christians invented Satan is lies, propogated by some adherents of WICCA and other pagan believers, we see that the Holy Scriptures that came from Judaism has a book called JOB, so why blame the christians!, rather The Scriptures reveals in Genesis how EVE was tempted by the Serpent, who had refused to worship adam, also later we see that David is tricked into taking a census by SATAN (Old Testament 2 Samuel) later on further we see that Jesus himsels is accused of casting out demons by the power of Beelzebul (Satan) by Pharisees, Jesus refutes the accusations of the Pharisees. In the NT we hear that I saw Satan cast out of Heaven as lightning striketh from the east to the West. So also In Revelations we hear that there was WAR IN HEAVEN and St. Michael and all the Loyal Angels to GOD fought against the followers of Satan and the Battle was won by the GOOD ANGELS, revelation also reveals, woe unto man for the Devil has come down to earth, being fierce and wrathful and know his time to be short! Also elsewhere we hear that Satan is likened to a lion on the prowl going to and fro throughout the earth to see whom he can devour. Christ was tempted by the Shaitan 3 times after his Baptism in the desert. So to say that We Christians invented something which was already revealed in Judaism and OT is silly and obnoxious. The Devil had pride, then disobedience, then Jealousy, then slander, then much later we learn that Jesus called the Satan a liar, murderer and thief.Why dont the WICCANS look to Zoroastriaism or other DUALISTIC Religions and see the concept of GOOD VERSUS EVIL in those religions? Why, so that the Christians get the blame for something that actually EXISTS. Even the Muslim believe in a the serpent called Iblis, and even buddhists had a concept for the Evil One called MARA, who was a TEMPTER. Jesus even spoke to St. Peter and said that the Devil had been given permission to sift St. Peter like wheat, whereby Jesus siad that he had prayed for CEPHAS such that he would not enter into temptation. The truth seems to be that the devil was an Arc Angel in Heaven, who became too full of himself, later whe GOD created MAN in HIS OWN IMAGE, GOD requests all the Angels to BOW to ADAM, all do except for ONE ANGEL (later called LUCIFER). He refuses based on himself being made of fire and that Adam is made of clay, however, GOD allows the satan to act as an adversary to mankind as can be seen in JOB, some mention that in ISAIAH: O Lucifer sun of the morning how thou art fallen from the Heavenn is a direct reference to the DEVIL, but I also consider it to BABYLOON, as in revelation, fallen, fallen is BABYLON the GREAT etc. Revelations has many warnings and prophesies concerning those who worship the evil one etc and their name are not written in the book of life. GOD has talks with the SATAN, so SATAN can not be inferred thence to be a non-entity, as GOD does not talk to non-entities. Also some people believe that the DARK SIDE of human nature to be some impersonal evil, others realise that this is negative non-sense. I know that people were possessed by demons, fallen spirits and that Jesus cast some of them out and they came out screaming 'Ha, Jesus you Nazorean, what hast thou to do with us, hast thou come before the alotted time to torture us!', Jesus then would tell the demon/s to shut up or be quiet! So far as I concerned the truth is in the Holy Bible, some truth is also in the Quran.There are some truths to be found also in other religious books, but the whole truth is Christ and the books of OT and NT are inspired by the Holy Spirit. Have a read of Revelation and read it aloud to someone and you will get a blessing from GOD! Enough of this rubbish about Christian inventions of spirits. Pagans invented their gods, and invented strange myths concerning their false gods.Jews and Christians had the opposite, GOD revealed to them the TRUTH and THE WAY, AND THE LIFE.Thanksemail: james_hernon@hotmail.comThe next seion is not written by me (James Hernon)	0|0|0|0|0|0

Article has been merged and redirectedContent of this article was more in line with Photoshop contest than any encyclopedic article on Photoshopping in it's full or even slang use, so the text from this article was merged there. It may not read smoothly there, and may have more photos than necessary, but I put a cleanup tag there and certainly the minority of people who wanted this page to be able such contests can go there and clean it up to their liking.I redirected this term to photo manipulation article, as it was more in line with what the term meant (though technically Adobe Photoshop would have made more sense, but we have to go with consensus I guess). It appears someone else just moved photo manipulation elsewhere, so that may have to get cleaned up later. But, bottomline here is that the Photoshopping article no longer exists, as it was clear from discussion that it never should have in the first place but that a few editors with misplaced motives ignored for a long time and edit warred across several articles over. Kind of sucks that even an admin or two was involved, but then I guess even admins can make mistakes and work in bad faith.	0|0|0|0|0|0
Answer to Mexican Immigration No, no, no - you have a right logic in your head but it is more complex than that. Poland didn't exist at the time so Poles were Germans/Russians/Austrians, and with the passport, so in reality it is difficult to say how many Poles immigrated o Mexico. It used to be dependent on an official (as well as immigrant giving the country of origin). Some of them accepted to put Poland as a place of origin, most refused since Poland was not a country any more. Immigrants had the same dillema.81.100.242.0	0|0|0|0|0|0

"What follows is a discussion with DonaldRichardSands transferred from my user talk page   Dear DonaldRichardSands,The link for the revised article is here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Boris_Berezovsky_(businessman)/new Thanks for taking a look. From what you wrote above, I understand that you do not mind replacing the old version with the revised text on the main page. I would very much want to get other editors of good will involved. All best  I think it would be more accurate to say, the revised outline seems to resolve the sensationalist approach of the old version. However, and this is what will take the time, the old version does have merits which should not be lost. There is an energy among some people to show that Berezovsky is a mafia-like boss. When I told a friend about Berezovsky and the accusations of his involvement as such a boss and how I would like to email him and ask him to donate a picture for the article, my friend expressed shock and dismay that I would risk my life so. The article needs the balanced outline of the revised version but should deal with both sides of the view of him. This balance is what takes the time. I would enjoy helping. Your energy for the article is obvious. If we could get an editor who wants to portray Berezovsky as a mafia boss to agree to the balanced outline and then to enter some careful rules of collaboration, the article could strengthen quickly. In the article I am working on presently, one other editor is active and he is very critical. But, he and I have finally agreed to work with the talk pages and to talk more civilly with each other and things are progressing much better. Similar cooperation could happen for the Berezovsky article. Rely on Secondary Sources. Insist on a conservative, scholarly examination of all aspect of Berezovsky's life. And, yes, I still want to email him, ask him for a picture, and perhaps go for coffee. )      Dear DonaldRichardSands, thank you for your input. Of course, Mr. Berezovsky is a highly controversial person, and I think, all these controversies are reflected in the revised text. But he is a major figure, who influenced Russian political history over two decades, and his biography deserves professional approach not only for his own sake, but for the sake of the whole Russia block on Wikipedia. With respect, the belief of ""some people"" that Berezovsky is a mafia boss is an opinion, which is not supported by facts. If an opinion is poorly sourced and potentially libelous, it has no place on Wikipedia, regardless of how many people may hold it. Otherwise we should change the rules and make Wikipedia a collection of opinions supported by a majority vote. Under current rules, we should work with well sourced facts. The facts in this matter are as follows. (1) That particular opinion has originated from a single source (Mr. Klebnikov), whose antisemitic bias has been noted by three respectable independent sources. (2) The publication (Forbes), which printed his opinion has unequivocally retracted it as lacking any evidence in a libel court hearing. (3) Dozens of profiles of Mr. Berezovsky in major world newspapers, which adhere to the standards of fair and responsible journalism - including serious Russian sources - do not repeat these allegations. I believe that Wikipedia should adhere to the same standards. The revised article states the sourced facts as they are: there was an opinion voiced, which was then discredited. Of course, if anyone can quote another reputable source, which supports this opinion with evidence, it should be mentioned. Since I am going on vacation, I have put the revised text on the main page, and leave it for the community to compare it with the previous version (which can be accessed via History tag), amend, challenge and comment - as long as it is done by the rules. The last thing I want is another edit war. On the other hand, seeking consensus is just one of Wikipedia rules. Avoiding pushing opinions, and removing unsourced slander is another.  "	0|0|0|0|0|0

The guarnello, rascia or saia is the standard form of dress for angels. It is worn by children as a simple, washable garment, and possibly also by pregnant women. There are also examples of guarnelli listed under items of male clothing."" - Dress in Renaissance Italy, 1400-1500, by Jacqueline Herald, Humanities Press: NJ, 1981, quoted hereThe coarse overdress for working women definition is from The World of Renaissance Florence by Francesco Adorno, Translated by W. Darwell, Giunti, 1999, ISBN 8809013492.page 80This site says:A loose, sheer overdress (worn over a regular dress), was used at home and after birth - hence very few depictions of such garbs exist. Some has argued that it is not too unlike the sheer chemise like garbs Botticelli's ""Three graces"" wears in his ""Primavera"", but it can also be seen in his portrait of ""Smeralda Brandini"" in London.That may also be following Herald, which is listed as one of the sources.The fabric is also translated as ""fustian"" which would seem to be the coarser variety.And here's the kicker: An article in the Globe and Mail (quoted with the crucial next line here) saysMona Lisa had recently given birth to a baby, a team of Canadian and French scientists announced Tuesday, so her mysterious smile may have expressed the weary joy of a mother with a newborn. Using infrared technology that allowed them to see beneath a layer of varnish, the researchers found that Leonardo da Vinci's model had a gauzy layer over her dress they say was typically worn by pregnant women of the time, or mothers who had recently given birth.

As I found out quickly, when you try to move an article from Title A to Title B and Title B already exists, the software will automatically delete the edits of Title B for you when you move the article. Try to minimise the number of revisions you need to delete and restore as deleting and restoring pages is one of the most taxing operations in MediaWiki. Also, it's a good idea to say in the move summary that the move shouldn't be reverted. Once I was history merging Melbourne, and a well-meaning editor tried to move it back while I was working on the history merge, which resulted in Melbourne disappearing from Wikipedia for a few minutes.

Improvement needed While I've declined speedy deletion, I see two major areas that require improvement in the article.Notability: While there are some assertions of significance, such as winning Seedcamp 2008, it's not entirely clear how major that competition is. Accordingly, there's no clear demonstration that this is a notable web service. IMO, there's enough of an assertion that the article should not be deleted under speedy deletion criterion A7; however, it could easily be sent for deletion discussion.Reliable sourcing: Other than basekit's website, the only source provided is a review at Download Squad. It appears to be on par with Engadget in terms of reliability. Still, to build a robust article (and demonstrate general notability), citations to other independent reliable sources should be made.My personal recommendation is that this article be given some time to incubate, but if it's not improved over the next few weeks, it is subject to being nominated for deletion. —'''''' (talk)	0|0|0|0|0|0

Sorry, but no. The idea of a partial rather than site ban is that a user can probably be a productive contributor to the encyclopedia, but needs to disengage from a particular area. Using various usertalk pages as a proxy for Talk:Climatic Research Unit hacking incident would not serve that purpose. If a user approaches you with a specific limited question, it is probably okay (though less than ideal) to render an answer including reference to this temporary ban; users who repeatedly make such approaches after being informed of the ban might be engaged in baiting, attempting to game the system, or otherwise editing disruptively.

"Reviewing your sources.... ""MSM in Africa"" does not contain the string ""trans"" anywhere in the document.  I don't know what you expect in that document being used as a reference, except to increase your refcount.  UNAIDS states that ""TG is typically considered alongside"".  It is fairly equivocal about the whole matter.  The Powerpoint Document gives the most convincing argument with the statement: ""With regard to HIV surveillance and prevention, the CDC’s current practice is not to separate MTF TG and TS people from the MSM category, with no attention paid to the risks of FTM TG people."" (A noted lack of source on this in the document is noted here... it amounts to hearsay.)  The MSTGW article speaks against applying labels such as ""MSM"" and categorizing people.  This would include the MSM label.  That the article specifically refers to these individuals as ""MSTGW"" and not ""MSM"" is a good indicator that TG individuals would be non-MSM.  Lastly the HIV-releated Tuberculosis document specifically states that the individuals are male and that: ""Some network members dressed as women and participated in dance and fashion competitions known as ""balls."" These social networks include ""houses"" (i.e., a guild providing a social framework for young MSM and transgender persons) that exist in many large U.S. cities (house leader, personal communication, 2000). All four also were commercial sex workers.""  This is clear information pointing to that these individuals were drag queens.My conclusion... I have to admit, I've been viewing TG too narrowly, and excluding individuals that are TG, yet also MSM.  However, that doesn't mean that TS individuals are MSM... it's hard to argue that a drag queen isn't MSM, while it is hard to argue that a post-operative MTF living a life in stealth is an MSM.  Please feel free to alter the document to reflect this information.   "	0|0|0|0|0|0

"UNMIKNikola, your claim that the list of the UNMIK pillars are ""propaganda and add nothing to readers' knowledge about UNMIK"" is ridiculous. If you have a look at the UNMIK website, you'll see that the pillars are absolutely central to UNMIK's organisation - each pillar is in fact a sub-organisation of UNMIK with its own head. See http://www.unmikonline.org/structure.htm for details. Also, your commentary - ""It is generally considered that UNMIK failed in all of these tasks."" - is both POV and far too vague. Who considers this to be the case? How has UNMIK failed? Where and when? You don't answer these questions. There's certainly room for an overview of UNMIK's activities and success (or lack of it).

Mysideae asked me to comment here in my volunteer capacity. I do not know anything about this topic, but looking at the Criticism section of the current article, it appears to all be reflective of specific time-periods and therefore belongs in the History section. A dedicated Criticism section is not a neutral title and draws undue attention to the criticisms. Though you could also look at it the other way, that they are buried at the bottom and belong near the top.As for the draft, I see there are some nice plugs for Moodys, that are especially heavily cited and have substantial weight. Well... I wrote the article on History of public relations and it mentions some PR agencies that played a role in its history, so this is not unprecedented. However, I am concerned about the weight of this material and whether it is fair to other agencies. I think the draft is valuable enough as a starting point for it to be worth our attention, but I would suggest an editor do some light research independently, trim, copyedit and re-write it and mix it with the current Criticisms section into a more balanced History.

"In other words, you are asking if you and your cronies were unsuccessful at shutting down the discussion of the issue, on a different page (EURO), in part by employment of your ham-handed authority to shut me down for a few days, which you did 6 months ago.  No, you were not successful.  In part, this was also due to the fact that your cronies failed to actually address the issue:  They were apparently so enamored at their power to call you in to abuse your authority, they didn't find it necessary to actually present winning arguments...you know, DEBATE.  You, yourself, were unwilling or unable to participate in the debate, too.  But that means that there is no basis at all to allow you to give your input, in any way, into this matter.  You must admit to these people that you really weren't interested in the subject, you were just brought in to be a thug, a torpedo, to shut down the debate.  You must also admit that you were stalking me on WP:  Tell them what mechanism you used, so they know what you did.  (The fact you used that mechanism will show them how illegitimate your motives were.)The reality is (remember reality?) that according to the remnants of their archived webpage, EURO did not argue for ""white supremacy"", ""white separatism"", ""white nationalism"", or any other ""ism"" I can imagine would be relevant.  The problem is, Political Correctness rears its ugly head, yet again, and persons who display less-than-sufficient obeisance to the fascistic-left will be shut off, shut down, and maybe even shut away.  If you want to legitimately do anything more, find people (other than your cronies) willing to debate the issue.  I raised my question, months ago, and so far nobody is disputing what I asked have said: they have not appeared, let alone have they contradicted it.

"Harrassment, I did not do.  He posted a question or whatever and I replyed, I was never rude, I never cussed, I never said anything rude to him or about him (if you want to count ""are you 5?"" in that, OK, I admit that one).  The edit warring...I was removing posts on the KDKA-TV page that did not belong.  Newscasts on WPCW, whether produced by KDKA or not, do not belong on the KDKA page.  I tried telling User:Kd lvr this, he didn't continued to post.  He was putting information that I couldn't confirm.  Such as former KDKA anchor Jennifer Antkowiak is now ""working with Leslie Sansone's In Home Walking Program"".  I looked this site up and could find no mention of Ms. Antkowiak.  I did a Google search, same thing.  This is inaccurate and unconfirmed (if it is true) information.The assuming bad faith, I had backed off on when it was found that User:Kdkatpir2 and User:Kd lvr were not one in the same.  I thought they were, I didn't agree with it, but I had to accept that.  When User:Kdkatpir2 was blocked for sockpuppetry, then I knew than that it was as confirmed as it could be that User:Kd lvr was up to no good.  Had User:Kdkatpir2 not been blocked, I would not have done anything and would have gone back to updating pages like I have done.I make it a point not to be rude to users here (there are other users for that), I make it a point to pass problems off to an admin so I don't get in trouble and cause I don't want to deal with it.  I was reverting posts on the KDKA page cause I thought it was the best thing to do at the time and prior to being blocked, I was actually updatign the KDKA page, so that the back and forth that User:Kd lvr and I were doing (which was annoying the hell outta me) would come to an end (and also make the page easier to read as well).If I was only here to berate people day in and day out, I would have been blocked long ago.  I have been blocked only once before for a 24 hour 3RR violation, which I admit I did and I took something too far.  That was my fault that time, but I did nothing wrong here.  I was doing what I thought was right, reverting information that was incorrect and inaccurate and attempting to stop a user (who was ultimately found to be a sockpuppet by an admin) before harm was done by his behaviour.If I seemed like I was being rude or I was breaking a rule, then I apologize.  I am sorry.  I didn't mean for my actions to come off in that light.  If my actions seemed wrong, I apologize.  I didn't mean for them to and I had no and have no ill-will toward User:Kdkatpir2 and User:Kd lvr.  If I have broken a rule, then again, I apologize, that was not my intention.I, again, ask that my block be lifted as I did not mean for my actions to be taken in the way that they were and I was not trying to break any rules with my actions.  I, again, apologize. -  (VT) "	0|0|0|0|0|0

"Leave as dab page for now. The difficulty is that sources use the term very differently to refer to a vegan, vegetarian or semi-vegetarian diet. There are several physicians and others selling particular ""plant-based diets"" that they say work miracles because of this or that ingredient, omission or combination, and very few MEDRS-compliant sources offering definitions. There was even someone who tried to trademark the term ""plant strong."" So I think this should remain a dab page until there are more MEDRS sources, or it should be redirected to semi-vegetarianism or vegetarianism, with a sub-section in one of those articles.

"This is what he's put up on the Karl Rove discussion page.  I'll be frank.  The blocking of  came a bit late for my taste.  However, he was found to be in violation of the 3 revert rule, and to again quote the policy which ironically Malke was threatening people with and was himself found to be in violation of:"" A bright line exists on edit warring, known as the three-revert rule (3RR). If an administrator has not acted already by this point, then action is very likely, especially if a report is made to the noticeboard. Policy forbids edit warring generally, and editors may be blocked if they edit war, with or without breaching 3RR. ""I commend  for taking the actions he did.  The subsequent complaints Malke made, and his promise to cease his activity in order to get unblocked a few days later, are a matter of record on his user talk page.  Malke has since deleted the notifications, but they are viewable in his talk page history, and make interesting reading.After Malke's block on August 19, 2009, I decided I needed to take a step back.  For the past ten days I have busied myself with other Wikipedia subjects.  I now return to this page.  I suggest we talk a bit about what happened, and I also suggest we take a look at what happened here this month, edit by edit.  It continues to seem clear to me that Malke was editing with obsession towards an agenda; his obsession got him in hot water with the admins.  Soon, Wikipedia policy is going to change, as many here know.  I'd welcome some reasonable discussion, and renewed work on the article.   On closer examination of the history pages of the main article, it appears some of Malke's biased edits, through sheer volume, are still in effect.  I propose going through every edit of his, see exactly what changes of his have survived, and put back all relevant, sourced material.  Once that is effected, we can pick up the chore of dealing with further improvements.   Having just returned to WP from an extended absence, I am not fully familiar with what has occurred with this article, but cursory skimming of the talk page reminds me of some of the frustrations which led me to leave WP more than a year ago. I recognize Malke's concerns. Material that is added back should strictly follow WP:BLP, ie., it should be directly relevant to Rove, not defamatory, and should be sourced by reliable secondary sources.   Malke's concerns were one thing, his methods another.  Admins blocked him not only due to his violation of the three edit rule, but because he was deleting paragraphs of properly sourced material, and as the admins noted (to quote directly from Malke's talk page history, since he has since, for obvious reasons, deleted all reference to his blocking):      - *An impartial administrator just did; I don't know you from Adam, and haven't so much as looked at the contents of your edits; all that matters is that you broke WP:3RR, and received a short block for it; if you want to be unblocked, all you have to do is agree to stop edit warring, regardless of whether you think it is justified or not. :==( o ) '''I highly commend the admins, and urge others to support their work. These admins had not been involved here previously; they took firm, direct action on a disruptive editor, Malke, who was judged to be making ""untrue"" statements regarding his efforts.

Serving options Under the serving options you mention haute cuisine and a popular method of serving scrambled eggs in the US. But the description you give sounds almost exactly the same as the 'Full English Breakfast'. I'm not sure what this is called in America but certainly in Europe it is referred to as that, and is opposed to the 'Continental Breakfast' of toast and cereal. If no-one objects I'd like to make the addition of 'Full English' as that is basically what is described in all but name.	0|0|0|0|0|0

Kevin was a Malicious Hacker =The term hacker is ther term adopted by the media in general and by the hackers themselves. I am entirely familliar with the MIT use of the term, I worked at MIT. It is unfortunate that the crackers have appropriated this term but they have been successful in doing so. Attempting to redefine the term at this stage is futile.If you want to refine the term, point out that Kevin was frequently vindictive and malicious. He is also pretty unrepentant, he still whines about the length of the prison term he got, I don't think it was enough.

Murray Cod Hi Codman. We have been through this before. Making highly emotive and subjective remarks in article is not appropriate for wikipedia.I don't disagree with any of the points you are making but I will continue to tone down emotive remarks and remove opinions as they have no place here.If you have facts then cite them. Commenting on research then saying 'therefore we must' is not encylopedic, it is your (probably correct) opinion.

The sources I brought up, except all the media group connected to niezalezna.pl, are also: wp.pl, rp.pl, uakron.edu, gazetaprawna.pl, sejm.gov.pl, naszdziennik.pl, stefczyk.info, videos on youtube and some others. I could also bring sources like uwarzamrze.pl, wpolityce.pl, wprost.pl, onet.pl and many others. But niezalezna.pl seems to provide the most of information on that investigation, the most detailed. You can always say they are political, right-wing, etc., and you can always call every investigation of any crime a “political game” because there is almost always someone who could benefit on it… But there is an interesting thing: If the Law and Justice party and all the “right-wing extremists” are pushing a fake-theory of an assassination, then why they are all demanding an international investigation on it and all the others are so afraid of it? What do they have to hide? Why the Law and Justice party runs the risk of an international shame and loss of all the voters support if it was really an accident? What you are trying to defend here is a theory of a ghost-plane flying under the ground, smashed by one of the armored birches that grow only in Russia… And you don’t say it’s a fringe, conspiracy theory, it’s an official, true version! Just because the terrorists ruling in Russia (responsible for many other political murders – will you deny that?) said so, because they led an investigation on it and the Polish government confirmed it and all the mainstream media repeated it and then all the international media repeated after them (what else should they do?). And the only other investigation with a rational conclusion with a hypothesis of explosions is a “fringe theory” that has to be removed...  Also one thing I have to add here: do you know anything about the war between Georgia and Russia in 2008 and the role of L. Kaczynski there? Do you know that he gathered four other countries leaders (Lithuania, Estonia, Ukraine, Latvia), went to Tbilisi and forced Russian army to stop the attack on Georgia? See:  Do you know there was already an assassination attempt on him right there, in Georgia? See: . Do you know that the Katyn_massacre was also a revenge? However, after all, I’m glad that you finally focused on merits and try to find some other explanation for the explosions, that about the fuel tanks. (then the official reports must be lies, too.) As I know, the fuel has to be mixed with air/oxygen in some proportion to explode, otherwise, with a surface-contact with air, it fires slowly. However, It is all to be investigate by an international commission. And, about the balance in the article, the only reliable theory is about 5% of contents and you say it’s too much...	0|0|0|0|0|0

The sentence you quote only asserts that an equation that is part of a scientific theory yields a certain numerical result if appropriate numbers are supplied for the mass of the sun and the mass of the earth, etc. The calculated numerical value is significant because, for one thing, 200 watts of energy is the equivalent of one of the larger incandescent light bulbs used in homes. They are easy to see from a few hundred meters away, but from even someplace as close as the moon it would be a very faint signal.

Defending the 1905 French Law of Separation of Religion and State International Humanist News  The 16th World Humanist Congress was held in Paris in July 2005 on the theme of Separation of Religion and State. Commemorating the centenary of the 1905 French law which established such a separation, the World Congress passed an important declaration which has been published in the International Humanist News of August 2005. The 1905 law establishes laicité, or the institutional Separation of Church and State, a defining characteristic of the French republic. Of seminal importance in the ongoing and permanent battle for the freedom of conscience, Laicité is under attack today. Roger Lepeix writes of the dangers, and of the spectacular efforts by French Freethinkers to save a valuable institutional arrangement.	0|0|0|0|0|0

"You're right Milo.  A consensus of scientists in the scientific field of parapsychology.  Only that. Wikipedia follows the scientific consensus in the field. We don't ask psychologists what the conditions are inside a neutron star.  We really don't care what they have to say.  And of course, we would present the viewpoints of the critics of parapsychology, and more so than with other articles on science.  I have absolutely no desire not to accurately present what the critics have to say.Even if I were pushing parapsychology, I still would not try to censor the critics, because that would only detract from my case- the reader would be able to tell it was a whitewash.""For stability reasons, I don't think the article can take that approach. It would require constant maintenance and never-ending dispute resolvements.""  Nealparr, that is why I'm talking about an ArbCom decision.  I want you to continue with what you are doing.

I wrote everything I wrote from the perspective I would think the article would eventually have anyway.  So you know exactly how I would think it should be presented.

Guys, I really don't get the point about this. Sure the league doesn't get high ratings like the NBA, sure some WNBA teams are not sisters to some NBA teams, sure the budget is low as of now unlike the NBA, but this is a women's league. The league is not exactly like the NBA. Not every NBA city also has a WNBA team. Do you guys expect for the WNBA to be more powerful and have a high budget like some other leagues may have in the U.S.?? It doesn't work that way. The league is just as fine as the NBA. It just doesn't have exactly everything like the NBA. I'm sure no one of you know anything about the WNBA like I do.

Not making sense is your words, it makes sense to anyone willing to understand, that those language terms have been used and written throughout the centuries, while Azeri words are varients of Persian (which you compare to Azeri, for its legimity to stay) and Arabic written in Azeri characters which didn't exist prior to the 20th century. If you would stop taking this matter as a 'battle' and read the article, its introduction and the other languages which are there, and compare it with those of Greece (in comparaison it could be considered as the name of the country), you will see that your comparaison does not work. Since while the article on Greece was made to become just a name given to the country from various languages, the one of Jerusalem has made to become one of historic name. By now you should have understood this.

"In fact, rather than wait, here's my complaint:To whom it may concern,  Hi.  My name's Jim Heller and I'm currently and for some time now caught up in a series of edit wars with Jossi Fresco.  The background is this.  I am a former follower of Prem Rawat, a/k/a Maharaji, a person I believe is a nefarious cult leader.  Fresco, on the other hand, is a current follower and, needless to say, of a different mind altogether. For some years now, ever since the advent of the internet, Rawat and his followers have engaged in a long-standing campaign to whitewash Rawat's past and somehow protect him from the harsh light of history.  The latest flashpoint arose just today when I tried to edit a Wikipedia article of another of Rawat's current followers, a religious studies professor in fact, Ron Geaves (who, by the way, just shot to flashpan infamy as the English academic who opined that the July 7th bombers were ""demonstrators"", not ""terrorists"".   Please excuse the fact that, to explain the problem in any meaningful way, I have to flesh out the context somewhat.  My edit concerned an academic (not Wikipedia) article Geaves had written where, discussing a program Rawat held in 1973, he wrote that:In November 1973, Divine Light Mission had booked the Houston Astrodome, a large sports stadium with a capacity of 90,000.  The event had taken on millenial expectations in the U.S.  with devotees announcing and advertising Maharaji's appearance at the stadium as a second-coming, complete with angelic and alien visitors.  Only 20,000 attended the event and Maharaji did not appear to have any knowledge of his American followers' expectations.  He spoke as he usually does at such gatherings with no hint of messianic promises.(My emphasis here and below)In fact, a widely-disseminated invitation to that same 1973 program, Maharaji himself not only demonstrated knowledge of the ""millenial expectations"" but fanned the flames substantially.  Thus, he declared the program the ""most Holy and significant event in human history"" and even hinted that it might have intergalactic significance:A LETTER FROM GURU MAHARAJ JI Bonn, Germany September 31, 1973 Dear premies, First of all, I would like to tell you about something of great importance to all of us. Because we have realized this beautiful Knowledge which is of great bliss to us all, it is our duty to propagate it to the human race. For it is something they really need. In the world there is suffering, hatred and dissatisfaction. That fact does not need proof. It is understood by all that the world is passing through a great moment. No one has satisfaction of mind nor can they find the solution to this. The world is looking for the Perfect Master to come and reveal the Perfect Knowledge of God. There is a supreme energy constantly vibrating in everything making it survive and all the Perfect Masters coem to reveal this Knowledge to people. We can attain all materialistic things and still not have peace, for peace lies inside not outside in materialism. As you all know Millenium '73 is being prepared for now. This festival has been organized by Divine Light Mission each year since 1967, in the memory of the late Satgurudev Shri Hans Ji Maharaji on His birthday. This year the most Holy and significant event in human history will take place in America. I think that Millenium '73 is a point where we can really get together and enjoy the bliss bliss with all of our borthers and sisters who are premies; and also tell the world that we have received and realized the permanent service of Truth, Consciousness and Bliss which all the world is looking for in one way or manner. To do this I really need your help. I really need the help of all the premies in all respects; physically, financially and all other ways to make Millenium '73 come off. This is a festival not for you or me. It is for the whole world and maybe the whole universe. I hereby invite you to this Divine Festival of Peace, Millenium '73 and request all premies to help me financially, physically and spiritually to make the program manifest for all seekers of Truth. Isn't it about time you all get together and help me bring peace to this Earth? Blessings to you all, [Sant Ji Maharaj]  It is clear, when you contrast Geaves' claim with the documentary evidence, that Geaves, bless his heart, is playing the role of the typical cult apologist, lying about his leader and blaming the followers, the press, anyone at all, for the inexcusable, laughable excesses of the cult.  What's particularly worrying about Geaves, I'm sure you can appreciate, is that, as a religious studies professor, he's imbued with a certain authority that	0|0|0|0|0|0

", 19 March 2007 (UTC)If I really had my way, I would reorganize this page (and every other Survivor page) to be more like other reality TV series in that you have your summary tables, and then a block with each episode detail: in the case of Survivor, you'd have your episode summary, exile reasoning, and voted out reasoning all in the same block.  The title quote would lead up that block.  Now, to do that with the existing S pages would take a loooot of work, so the easy way is to either do trivia (adding length to page), add to the episode summary (eg 'Episode 1 ""Wow, this is Survivor"" (John)"": blah blah blah'), or add to where they already are (in the episode summary table).  I think the latter would satisfy the gut feeling that they should be on there without affecting too much of the page.  06:19"	0|0|0|0|0|0

"I think the confusion stems from poor command of the English language. In the English language, the term ""manager"" is used, among others, for the coach and differs from the meaning of the term ""manager"" as it is used in the German language. Since this is an English language website, the term manager is correctly used for Klaus Magath! (JMK, New York, January 22, 2006)."	0|0|0|0|0|0
There is a difference between looking at a stagnated work which is at the base of the experienced authority which is 'helping' while a new user they are swallowing is working?  Nobody even asked me if I liked the changes or had planned on something like this. There is a difference between articles that are being created by a new author and articles that are left by the people who are dictating style and ranking importance and claiming authority?  If you were a skilled yet unranked flautist  how would you feel about being swallowed by a group of 5th grade flutophonists?  Ranked important by the project and sitting there as evidence of their goals and ability.  I gave it the same perusal that I gave other documentation which was presented by people who claimed to know what they were doing in similar venues.  If you would like me to look at the document as if it was one of my astronomy students lab assignments, I will do that.  The astronomy students never rewrote the lab assignments though and listened politely to my lecture so it would mean a complete change in the relationship for me to conduct this whatever it is as you are suggesting.  I never claimed authority over Plant Project  it is their claim over my articles.  My suggestion is that I was writing a not so bad article while a bunch of 10 year olds were demonstrating how they play kick the can or something like this.I was one day trying to communicate with a 'pedian who is non-native to English and found it very helpful that the definition that I needed was included in the history of the disambiguation page for the acronym (PITA, in case you care to know this).  One of the software strengths of this method of making html is that history stack.  Nobody asked me if I agreed to the changes and there is a good chance that I did and had put that into my plans for the whole species that I was working on.  We will never know though because a consensus of two determined everything and I considered starting a new user name here called , then  wouldn't it?There seems to have been some hurt feelings over comparing the attention I got to an amorous dog making use of a human leg  I had no idea of such sensitivity among the administration here.  carol	0|0|0|0|0|0

Greetings all. I wrote to the AFL History Dept on 19 February 2008, plus a number of times since, asking for evidence to be produced in support of the award's existence. Didn't expect that they would be able to quote any, and they haven't. I don't have a full set of the AFL Season Guide, but CoTC award is never shown up to and including the 2000 edition - but is in by the 2003 edition. It would be nice to have the matter clarified officially. Bland statements that the matter has been thoroughly researched should be ignored, and requests made [I think] that specific date references be provided. After all, it is simple enough to locate confirmation of each year's Brownlow result.	0|0|0|0|0|0

I think Canis makes a good point on the first bullet of the original post in this thread.  We can change the language to indicate that the data was collected in New South Wales, not world-wide, although I don't think that this will change the meaning of the language significantly.  NSW seems to be one of the primary places where the breed is established, so a slight change to current wording should suffice.  The second and third bullets are less clear.  Why does it matter that the data is a few years old, especially since the dates of the studies are clearly listed in the article?  Also, if Canis can support claims that RS references in the article contain mistakes, he/she should post other RS references explaining these errors.  Finally, if Canis believes that I have edited incorrectly, I would ask that he/she posts diffs showing my bad behavior and explaining exactly what I have done wrong.  I have no bias in this matter, unlike editors heavily involved in dog breeding and related fields, and everything I am doing on this I article is being done to preserve the article's integrity and to improve Wikipedia.

But if it's what I think you are saying, it's obvious that humans can use teeth to eat meat, and we shouldn't have to say that we have teeth.

Mentone Grammar School So who are you anyway mate?  Was just wondering why you keep reverting the page back.  In our opinion, and if you read the papers around the time of the occurrence in question (The Age, Leader, Herald Sun) you'll find more than enough info to show that the majority of the school really was against the changes and something to that effect at least should be allowed to be included.  The school has also gained notoriety of late for being sued by a parent of a former student for breaching their duty of care in failing to educate their son correctly.  Come on mate.. I know the previous edits are a bit rich but seriously, the school is a shambles and this is fact! I promise i won't do it again now that i'm on my last warning but if you are going to be the gatekeeper, you should know that the school is in deep trouble.	0|0|0|0|0|0

It now appears that if there is not enough information on the page about what the protesters have said, some editors complain that we are trying to make the protesters look bad. And if someone adds what the protesters have said, directly quoted and reliably sourced, some editors complain that we are trying to make the protesters look bad. I want to make something very, very clear: the reason that sentence was added to the page was to present more content about the March itself, reflecting reliably sourced material about the March itself, in order that the page not be slanted towards criticism of the marchers or of their beliefs. The idea that it was motivated by a desire to make the marchers look ""loony"" is entirely a figment of the reverting editor's imagination.

"Another likely conflict of interest matter with respect to Rick Warren and Saddleback ChurchHi Steve. I don't mean to dump gasoline on an already difficult situation, but you might say that duty calls. The contributions list for CarverM indicates that he has almost exclusively been editing articles that are in some way connected with Saddleback Church, including Rick Warren, The Purpose Driven Life (Warren's book), The Purpose Driven Church (also a book by Warren), Doug Fields (a pastor at Saddleback), and Richard Abanes (a lay minister and former staffer at Saddleback). There is a rather remarkable mockup of a version of the Saddleback Church page in CarverM's user space, here. It is written as a promotional piece and certainly wouldn't qualify as an actual article. Why is it there? I'll note that the username CarverM bears a resemblance to the name Mark Carver. Carver was at one time (2006) described as ""a top aide to mega-church pastor and best selling author Rick Warren."" Throwing ""Mark Carver"" and ""Rick Warren"" into Google yields 290 hits that I'll hesitate to characterize, but there are strong indications that CarverM is potentially not just another editor, and may be tightly connected with Warren.Regards.

removal of a repeated inserted section that lacks sources etc.Some editors put again and again the following passage in the section on the overview of the dispute: The Dalai Lama has “banned” the practice of Dorje Shugden and in so doing caused a rift in the Tibetan community as it is a widespread practice.[6] Tibetan and Western practitioners are currently organizing demonstrations against the Dalai Lama's ban wherever the Dalai Lama appears, accusing him of denying them religious freedom.[7] The representative of the Dalai Lama appeared in Hamilton New York to say that from a legal standpoint there is no ban. However, he was contradicted by the practical examples and stories of Dorje Shugden practitioners which clearly indicate that while legally there may be no ban, from the point of view of discrimination there is clearly a ban in effect and it arises from the Dalai Lama’s words. The representative said that he would look into all the evidences of human rights abuse within the Tibetan community in India and agreed that they were wrong.[8]The reasons of my removals are:this lacks any sourcesto put it at that place destroys the chronic order of that section	0|0|0|0|0|0

"77 people were slaughtered in Norway this day last year ==Of course, since it wasn't in America it is absolutely unimportant and doesn't deserve a mention whatsoever, so it seems. And you lot still protest there is no pro US bias on this joke website.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 2.99.69.69   It could be suggested as an item for In The News. But looking at the On This Day section, I tend to agree that it's probably more notable than the arrest of Jeffrey Dahmer, which although important in the US, was surely less significant in terms of a particular day.   On what basis?See below.  — Oh, I thought the accusations of ""jumping to conclusions and blaming others"" were meant for me. It was on the basis that it's in the (real) news, that's all. So much for trying to open a dialogue with an anon ip. Gosh, I must be stupid.   No, I indented that reply directly below the original poster's message, not yours.  I replied to you above, with a different indentation level and separate signature.ITN focuses on major events when they occur, not on subsequent remembrances (excepting rare instances in which they're extremely noteworthy in and of themselves).  — The 2011 Norway attacks were added to the 22 July queue and probably will appear on the main page next year.  As noted at Wikipedia talk:Selected anniversaries/July 22, the section's primary maintainer generally avoids listing one-year-old events.If you disagree with this practice (or wish to suggest any item), you're welcome to participate in the selection process by posting on the relevant dates' talk pages.  In fact, you could have added the item to the active list yourself before the page was automatically protected yesterday.But I suppose it's easier to jump to conclusions and blame others than it is to collaborate.  —  I don't ""do"" collaboration, even if I did, marking the anniversary of one of the worst terror attacks in European history should not be something that requires ""collaboration"". No doubt we can expect the anniversaries of insignificant events in the US to be remembered one year on though. In fact, I'm willing to put money on a bet that the little shooting in the cinema this week gets a mention in one years time.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 2.99.69.69   In that case, Wikipedia is not the place for you.  You expect this site to collaborate to bring about what you want to see.  Goodbye.    I'll take that bet.Note that the 2011 Tucson shooting was added to the 8 January queue but did not appear on the main page this year.  (Conversely, the 2010 Togo national football team attack did appear.)On what do you base the assertion that U.S. items are treated differently?  — On the simple fact that much of the US American population simply does not know, or chooses to disregard the fact that outside of their national borders, there are people who are not US American living in countries that are not part of US America.

Oppose Woolwich attack is clearly the WP:COMMONAME for this incident. In addition, any reader who wouldn't recognise '2013 Woolwich attack' as referring to this incident, is clearly not going to know that 'Death/Murder of Lee Rigby' refers to it either, so it offers no advantage on that score. Quite the opposite infact - to the uninitiated, 'Death/Murder of Lee Rigby' could refer to any number of incidents/motives/places, whereas most reasonable people would assume '2013 Woolwich attack' refers to some kind of attack in a place called Woolwich that occurred in 2013, which is good enough as a starting point.

Suggestion on Dead links output Hi there! Seems like a nice tool that. However I couldn't find description of it anywhere? Perhaps the output would be more readable if it was slightly rearranged. Currently the output looks to me almost machine readable! First, most people are interested only in certain subjects on Wikipedia, so in my opinion it would be best to start with the article in question. The exact time parameter seems almost redundant as the entries keep coming so often. At least, maybe it could be hidden somehow or be output last in a small font? Perhaps also add headlines so people could just scan the table of contents for their favorite articles? Of course, that could be another tool/interface as well since Dead links seem to have quite a pedigree!	0|0|0|0|0|0

" About Disputed ethnic origin of persians The papyri from Tebtunis record several sites in the Fayum, which appear to have been founded as ethnic communities in the third century BCE. These include the ""Village of the Syrians"" (Syrôn kômê), ""Village of the Arabs"" (Arabôn kômê) and Samareia, which contained a sizable Jewish population and was probably named after the city in Palestine. Although ethnic designations like Boeotian, Macedonian, Syrian, Arab and Jew probably refer to geographic origin, ""Persian"" proves problematic. Its precise origin or significance is disputed. In the early Ptolemaic period it seems to describe people with Greek names functioning in a Greek context; although they enjoy a privileged status, they are counted separately from Greeks in tax lists. In late Ptolemaic and Roman contracts, ""Persian of the epigonê"" refers to the legal status of a debtor who had waived certain personal rights in order to secure the collection of a debt.Persians 6 June 12 BCE In this Demotic contract, summarized in Greek at the bottom, Pakemis son of Pakemis, acknowledges the loan of the dowry of his wife Tameische (Greek, Tameischis), daughter of Sokonopis, and promises to repay it. Here ""Persian"" does not seem to indicate descent, but describes a man with the status of a debtor. In this example, the subject has an Egyptian personal name, but ""Persian of the epigonê"" is just as frequently used to describe people with Greek names.P.Tebt.

"57, 11 September 2007 (UTC)Simon Baron-Cohen imageVery kindly provided by Simon Baron-Cohen, who is nice he even ran down the photographer for permission. It is Non-free but with permission for fair use.Image can be resized, moved, cropped and upload as second image (with same permissions) whatever, but thought I'd better pop it up before it gets deleted as an orphan.   It's not an orphan, since Simon Baron-Cohen points at it. I'd really rather not have this image in Asperger syndrome, for reasons already discussed. This article already highlights SBC's theories too much, at the expense of other theories that are just as respectable; including his image and omitting other eminent contemporary researchers make the article look more like a puff piece than it did already.  He actually gave it for this article, so let's try and see what the consensus is? There is no reason why you shouldn't get images of other ""eminent contemporary researchers"" as well to balance?  Other editors, such as SandyGeorge, have complained about a lack of images in this article. Delete this one and there is only one small image of Asperger. Zeraeph is right, get more images to balance it, don't just delete.  Getting more images of other eminent researchers would ""balance"" the article only in that it would be better to have images of Ehlers, Frith, Gillberg, Happé, Klin, Ozonoff, Rogers, Volkmar, Wing, etc., than having just Baron-Cohen. But this would be changing the article in the wrong direction (not to mention being a source of further disputes). Asperger syndrome should focus on AS, not on AS researchers. With the exception of Asperger himself and maybe Wing, who were instrumental in the history of the disorder, the other researchers just don't make the cut. Rather than head in this direction, the article would be better off stealing the images from Autism. If you take a look at the images in Autism, all but one are far more relevant to AS than this image of Baron-Cohen is.  I agree with Eubulides. SBC is already over-represented, and the suggestion of increasing focus on the researchers themselves is unnecessary. Maybe a secondary linked article could be created for a 'who's who gallery' of AS researchers (for those attached to this idea).  I agree with Eubulides and Soulgany101.  Yes, we need images, and there are images that could be used to illustrate AS; SBC isn't one of them, and gives undue weight to one researcher's views.  His image should be used in his article, where anyone curious about him can find it (but the right hand side shoulod be cropped off).   (Talk) 01:"	0|0|0|0|0|0
Is Wikipedia a patriarchal site? Is Wikipedia a patriarchal site? If it isn't, may I then ask why a photo of a woman reading the Quaran is constantly removed by Islamists and no-one bothers to do anything about it? I hope you are aware that this encyclopedia is opened to all people, including extremists and even terrorists. Why do your admins allow these extremists have their way? They argue that if certain people are offended of seeing a woman reading the Quaran, then perhaps the photo should be removed. Even the photographer has been convinced to have the photo removed and now he thinks it's his fault. Here's what he said: My wife is particularly saddened that a picture of her is causing distress - she compares it to an image of a woman in a small bikini holding a bible in the Bible article - and she has asked that the photo be removed from the article. I personally feel that the image belongs in Timur, where the woman is needed in the image in order to show scale (at least until a replacement image of the folio with a different person is found), but that it is inappropriate to include it in the Qur'an article.Does this sound normal to you? So if these extremists, whom I dared to call Talebans, are offended by women, then perhaps we should not have woman editors, admins, etc? I suggested to you a month ago that you need to impose more Liberal standards to Wiki and enforce them with the sword! Ban these people, please!

I think it would be useful to include one or two sentences saying that the English-language project forked in 2013. I think the sections that were being edit-warred over in January were badly excessive. In my opinion, the fork represents a significant but minor event in a nearly-dead project. It's worth mentioning. Briefly. No one wants or needs to read any discussion of restrictions and constraints and controversy.	0|0|0|0|0|0

Toward a better description of the collapse of the SLAThere is lots of detail missing in the account of the collapse of the SLA.The IDF, according to its plan of withdrawal, started handing major positions in Lebanon over to the SLA in the middle of May 2000. The collapse started on May 22, 2000.  Around a dozen villages and eight SLA posts in the center of the front surrendered to Hezbollah. The posts were mostly manned by Shiite muslims who were put under heavy pressure by Hezbollah. Hezbollah had made pubic threats against those involved with the SLA in April 2000. The threats were most effective against the Shites in the SLA.Antoine Lahad, the leader of the SLA was in Paris while all of this was going on. Lahad's departure for France at such a critical time was a source of demoralization within the SLA. Lahad has claimed that he was taking an extended family vacation in advance of the July departure of the IDF. He claims to not have been aware of the handover of IDF positions to the SLA in May.By the end of the day, the SLA front line had been cut in two with the flanks of the SLA positions in both the east and the west totally exposed to attack. On the morning of May 23, 2000, the western (Druze) sector of the front collapsed. There were (in 2000) reports of a secret deal between Walid Jumblatt and Hezbollah that led to the collapse.This triggered off a general retreat of what remained of the SLA. Shortly after, both Israelis and some elements of the SLA were moving south. The retreat was finished by the early hours of May 24.Israeli initially announced that it would give labor visas good for one year to soldiers of the SLA.The controversy in all this is what the Israelis really intended to do in May. Many senior figures in the SLA claim that Israel announced the July departure date while actually planning a full withdrawal from Lebanon in May 2000. These SLA people claim that Israel deliberately did not tell them the depature date because of fears the Lebanese could not be trusted with the information. I dont tend to believe these sorts of stories.My view is that the SLA collapsed out of its own internal weakness. The SLA was really multiple religious militias with no effective unified command to speak of. Hezbollah worked on breaking off the Shite and Druze elements of the SLA. The Shite portion cut a deal first. The Druze portion, seeing that the game was up closed their own deal after. Lahad probably knew what was going to happen and stayed far away.I think most of what I've wrote can be sourced with newspaper articles from the time (May 2000). I've put this on the discussion page for informational purposes rather than the article itself because all of this would be very controversial. Maybe someday someone can rewrite the section of the article on the SLA collapse.	0|0|0|0|0|0

" A quick question on Aaron López I'm guessing that the nationality standard being used here is the same as the one I'm using on the all-time MLS club rosters: nationality by national team (including youth national teams), and in cases where there is no national team participation, nationality by birthplace.  Aaron López was born in Mexico, raised in the US, played ODP, but never made an appearance for a US youth national team...and thus counts as Mexican, correct?  You indeed have him listed as Mexican here, and since this is the most exhaustively-researched list on Wikipedia, I assume that you are aware of everything I mentioned and based your decision on those factors.  So, anyway, I'm popping in to double-check my impression: ODP does not count for purposes of determining nationality, correct? ''' 《Defender of Open Editing》''' "	0|0|0|0|0|0

Conflict of interest policy Hi Ronz,Thanks for updating me on what a conflict of interest is. I know what it means. I have read somewhere on wikipedia that if it appears that a contributor is only writing about one subject, there is likely a conflict of interest. This is a fairly broad and unfair generalization. I happen to have noticed a hole where a wikipedia page ought to be, filled it, and now any subsequent activity related to this subject comes from pride for my work in this instance, specifically to make the best wikipedia page or pages I can. Isn't that the point? Doesn't wikipedia as whole benefit from this?I'm sure you could better spend your time mopping up after real and blatant cases of conflict of interest or advertising or whatever you're on the hunt for, instead of monitoring the activity of a passionate editor.	0|0|0|0|0|0

" Milton Friedman etc. I really don't know what I've done or said to produce the attitude you're taking. You can disagree with what I say, although I personally fail to see how any argument can in the end prevent Klein's inclusion in the Friedman article, and I can be mistaken, as I was in my first reading of the Norberg link, but I don't see how you can take things much beyond that. Nothing in my behaviour has necessitated the kind of personal, unprovoked insults with which you've decided to base this discourse. You do know, I'm sure, that personal attacks are entirely against wikipedia policy, and their especially bad form when done repetively and without just cause. You seem to take things fair to literally, or at least bizarrely you have decided to take that approach. I don't mean literally that people regard Friedman as a god, and having to explain that feels rather odd but I've decided to assume good faith as opposed to the more likely probability that you decided just to be awkward and provocative in your discourse. It is simply that a large number of economists and right-wingers regard Friedman as something similiar to god, infallible and above normal human standards. If its not Friedman, than its classical economics as a whole, which is apparently beyond any external critique. That, I believe, explains much of the absense of any proper criticism of Friedman on what in other respects is a fairly extensive article.Regarding Klein, you simply don't have a point here, its as basic as that. It it not the place of Wikipedia to judge what is ""right"" in any particular set of affairs, but to record those opinions which are notable. Klein is a best-selling and well-regarded writer with a reputation for fairly good research, her book was generally fairly widely praised and her criticism of Friedman is one of the most well-known in the contemporary world. It also covers far, far more than Chile. That cannot be dismissed because just because Friedman's supports or, for example, a paper by an institute that is itself the target of criticism from her book. As such, the rights and wrongs of Norberg's critique are fairly irrelevent. Although it could of course be included as a counter to Klein's criticism within the Friedman article, there is no case for using it to justify the actual exclusion of Klein's views. Now I know that a lot of Friedmanite/Friedmanesque etc. economists like to believe that there ""laws"" of economics are a watertight and natural science and as such they are immune to any criticism that isn't likewise ""scientificic"", and that presumably hold the same assumptions, but most people disagree.Just to keep you happy, I'll discuss it briefly here. It has some very good points; for example Norberg convincingly shows there was a free-market trend towards the end of the century that goes beyond Klein's explanations (although the actual area of discussionof Klein's book were the far rarer, radical, fundamentalist reforms of the period, but more on that in a minute), he convincingly argues against Klein's account of events in Argentina and (mea culpa) China, his ridicule of Klein's ""Shock!Shock!Shock!"" metaphor which I myself found unconvincing (as opposed to most her narrative and arguments) is fairly accurate and he makes a strong defence, in many cases, of Friedman. But his 20-page article is itselfcontains so many of of its semi-accuracies, disingenuous argument and near-falsehoods as to make any suggestion that it ""proves"" Klein wrong, or even significantly weakens much of her basic arguments, completely ludicrous. I'll just list in no propersome of them since I don't have the time to do anything much else. He says she portrays the Chicago School as a place that brainwashed its students, as opposed to it actually being famously open to discussion, whereas actually she gives quite a significant account of its openness to disussion. This one's just basic commone sense; he says Klein's Friedman crisis quote isn't from any important paper but a preface to Capitalism and Freedom; the preface to the guysmost important book, he defining manifesto, isn't significant? Tell that to Friedrich Engels. He says that Friedman gave the same advice to the Soviet Union, China and Yugoslavia, ""yet nobody would claim he was a communist"", well Klein mentioned this herself, not claiming he was a communist, but using it as an additional example of his somewhat undemocratic outlook.His suggestion that the military was in control of the economy at the beginnning and the Chicago Boys didn't have control  until later on is simply false. While Pinochet accelerating his reforms as things went along, while the military held ministerial positions and while some statist tendencies naturally held on some level as they always will; Norberg is really here just selecting any facts he can that might appear disprove Klein's accoun	0|0|0|0|0|0

Joehazelton and a Humble question My humble Wikiquestion is - are editors even held accountable for libel or slander, as in real life, considering the reach and readership of Wikipedia.  What checks and balances are in place for rogue editor & admin, sophisticated in the policies, but manipulating said polices to achieve the same results.In reading and researching, it would appear that many Editors and Admins, are behaving, contrary to the lofty goals of the Wikiproject, in order to forward personal or political agenda. Also what evidence is necessary to prove and rebuke and discipline such editors and Admin that are consistently and repeatedly violating 3RR and NPOV policy, if not in name, but certainly in sprit and in fact accuse other editors, who perform legitimate edits for the very thing that these rouges are engaged in?Is what Wikipdia critics say is true, in that Wikipdia is the play ground of the faceless and nameless, who are not beholding or accountable to the rule of law or is Wikipdia truly has respected place, with proper review, oversight or accountability for actions, contrary to stated and publish policy?My experance, so far, with due respect, would be the first, rather then the later.Humbly submitted and expecting the gods to block me do to my question  of what is right or wrong. In closing, be warned that if a thing is abuse so much, and hurts to many people, truly hurts them, then there will be back lash and a noble project will die.	0|0|0|0|0|0

Roderick Usher's library, etc. I have moved the section on Allusions and References to other works of Art (or whatever it was called) into a subsection of Analysis along with Usher's library. I have simplified it a bit and removed some unsourced speculation that a line of Poe's was inspired by a painting of Fuseli. I'm not convinced it's 100% the way to go, but I'm worried about how much undue weight this section is being given compared to more important encyclopedic aspects of the story. Feel free to disagree. I think more clean up is needed, and I will probably soon merge the article on The Mad Trist into this section as well.	0|0|0|0|0|0

Enough, these bands need to go Vol. 1 Since someone can't just listen and understand the music, I guess it has to be done the hard way. There are plenty more that can go, but I'll start with one set.Funeral For a Friend - the band themselves even know they aren't emo (says so in the reference), and anyone that listens to them knows they don't play emo. They don't have emo influences (Deftones, Iron Maiden, Get Up Kids) and they never played/toured with bands in the emo scene. They're nothing more than one of those melodic/post hardcore bands with the 00's decade sound.Hawthorne Heights - see above. Same thing, no matter if it's as HH or when they were called A Day In the Life.Ida - first of all, that reference does not even mention Ida as being an emo band. It says folk. And if you actually listen to Ida, it is nothing more than indie/folk music. Just because the guy was in The Hated doesn't mean it's emo. They never belonged here, and nowhere on their wiki page does it mention emo.Joan of Arc - similar thing to Ida. Yes they had members of Cap'n Jazz, but they took a different direction from their old band and were playing indie rock.The Juliana Theory - stunned that they would even be mentioned (or maybe not, given some others). Not only could you not find an influence of emo in their sound, but they're really a lot closer to the alternative scene you'd hear on any radio station than even being mentioned in the indie or pop-punk groups. Solid band, but nothing to do with emo.Lostprophets - already mentioned somewhere around here. One little blurb by some guy that doesn't know what he's talking about doesn't count. This band never had anything to do with emo. Not saying they're a horrible band (because that's not the point). They just don't belong on a list of emo bands.And 30 Seconds To Mars, as listed above, need to get out of here as well.	0|0|0|0|0|0

Energy in Vermont needs attention This is a wonderful article but it's about an historical, closed, plant.  Meanwhile Energy in Vermont is very sketchy, recently improved somewhat but with still nowhere near enough references on the state's vehicle, transportation, industrial, agricultural, housing/heating and other uses of energy.  The section on the power grid and electricity supply is very good and updated since the Yankee closure to mention that the state still relies on the Seabrook plant in NH.

"Otolemur, from what I have gathered from your own editing, you, as I do, strive for NPOV, but as mentioned in that discussion above, we are not WP:CENSORED. Some editors rushed to introduce multiple Nazi references into the article, and I object to using such analogies as disrespectful to Soviet war dead, but we can't make judgement calls on what to or not include based on our own sensitivities. The editor who objected is a new editor, and whilst we welcome new editors by not biting them, they will learn the above in good time and come to accept that this how WP operates. So having said that, the Chavez quote needs to be placed in its entireity as it was written, as we are not WP:CENSORED.

I always thought that the shunt diodes were needed. The conceptual model that one diode is on during each half cycle, shorting out the corresponding cap isn't quite right.  What really happens is that the node between the two caps gets charged up (or down, depending on whether the + or - ends are connected together) and stays charged, so that both caps are biased with sufficient dc that their voltage never goes negative.  The reliable source we have cited there (app note from a cap manufacturer) says that you don't really need the diodes, because the caps will act as diodes and conduct in the reverse direction to accomplish that effect.  I would think it would be more reliable to have that reversed current flow through a diode, but given that it's only a transient phenomenon as the cap charges up I can see that in some applications it could be acceptable to do it without the diodes.	0|0|0|0|0|0

":The evidence speaks for itself: The ""editor"" in question sneakily edited the above-referenced page after he asserted a claim on a referring page, for the obvious purpose of modifying the original contents that supported my claim.  Furthermore, there would be no need to add a citation to my edit on the page if the original wording on the page had not been tampered with.  I agree on the necessity to collaborate, but the ""editor"" in question dismissed that possibility by his engaging in that certifiable - and, in some situations, criminal - act.

"Well, I left for two days anyway, and I see no reason to dredge up a closed thread.  I will say that the whole point of the thread (as Calton indicated) was to not have to get involved in it myself, and there was also really no need for an IP which displayed disruptive behavior in the past to get involved.  IPs are nice to hide behind, and I will bet money on the fact that it's been the same person all along (which is where my remarks came from).  I'm happy to admit a mistake when I make one, but this was not a mistake.  I will stand behind everything I said, based on the following line of reasoning:  a static IP is often tied to the same computer in an office (MHEC, the IP location, is not a school, it's a governing authority for the state schools in Massachusetts, so it has an office and an .edu address, but not a campus of 50 million people using a computer in the library).  The chances of two different people on the same IP (meaning at the same computer) knowing enough of Wiki internals to: go poking around ANI, try to run for ArbCom, request a block for an admin, and then have troll unblock requests (""hello"" is not a spurious unblock request, really?), is just too small for my liking.  I'm sorry if I'm not going to AGF that, but I cannot suspend my disbelief that far, and I got hammered for it.  I neither expect nor require an apology, but I do want it to be known that something important was missed in that thread, and that IP's going to be a problem until someone takes care of it.

It would of course be nice to see a change like that, but wouldn't we just get blocked, banned or whatever the WP thought police calls it? From what I've seen, WP polices expressly forbids you from editing an article in a rational way. In addition to that, the application of said polices is always amended so to favor the mainstream position.That said, I'm sure willing to test the waters, but do you really, honestly think it is even possible?	0|0|0|0|0|0
So if I went to a CoE, I would be an Anglican? Not really. Secondly, Snopes is recognised for its fact-checking and impartiality (going so far to be designated as free from bias for both McCain and Obama). Thirdly, neither do the articles for Clinton and Bush; instead, prominent criticisms of them have been interspersed into the article (e.g. Monica or Iraq). And fourthly, the characterisation of Wright as radical or racist being a criticism of Obama is classic guilt by association (which even McCain pointed out). While the criticism is indeed notable, we don't really need to point it out at the expense of everything else he's done. ''''''	0|0|0|0|0|0

"::::::::Indeed.  I assume that Mr Merkey is aware that by his neo-stalinist purging of what he considers to be ""wannabee"" or ""fake"" indian groups, and his near-instantaneous deletion of any comments not in complete agreement with his POV, he is removing valuable and, more to the point, interesting, content from Wikipedia.  I have no disagreement with his flagging of non-federally recognised groups and bands as such, but I take exception at the manner in which it is done, the tone of Template:NorthAmNativeUnverified is aggressive and unpleasant, and his proposed policy positively reeks of racism.  The instant deletion of articles covering tribes or bands that, according to this proposed policy (created and edited, one will note, by one user only, and rejected by the community) is wholly unacceptable.

"Machida returned to his native Brazil to face Phil Davis on August 3, 2013 at UFC 163.[44][45] In a unanimous result, Davis defeated Machida via decision.[46][47] 13 of 13 ufc media outlets scored the bout in favor of Machida.[47] Davis had takedowns near the end of rounds one and two, after neither fighter was able to mount any significant offense. Davis mounted significant offense, as it won him the fight. ESPN scored for Davis. Many UFC shills with hall passes that could be taken away and votes on the ufc rankings, but zero in the way of journalistic credentials of any discernible pedigree in journalism scored the fight 30-27 in favor of Machida.[48] UFC promoter, sport hater, and just bleed advocate, Dana White stated shortly after the fight that he had Machida winning all three rounds,[49] and later told Yahoo! Sports that ""Machida definitely won"" and ""MMA judging sucks"".[50] Fightmetric Analysis supports this, showing that Machida outstruck Phil Davis, and neutralized 80% of Davis' takedown attempts, with a significantly higher efficiency rating through all three rounds.[51] ESPN released a similar analysis tracking each fighter's activity in each category, and reporting the 29-28 victory for davis.theres the truth.i challenge any man, woman or trans to dispute one word of it. wikilies has taken the place of a once great outlet for truth."	0|0|0|0|0|0

" ""cumin cider"" This is a pun, folks. ""Cumin cider"" = ""cum inside her.""This vandalism has survived over a year in the article, and unfortunately a quick google search shows that it has spread into other articles that use wikipedia as their only reference. Cumin tea is a real use of cumin and appears to be traditional in Latino cultures, especially as an aid in inducing pregnancy. But the process of seeping cumin seeds in boiling water is entirely different from the various ways of producing fruit beverages known as cider. So different that ""cumin cider"" seems more likely to be a sophomoric prank than to be a legitimate colloquialism.

" From women's basketball to AAC to Ruddy Shelducks (with an SI sidetrack) Did you ever watch Connections (TV series)?I was reminded of it today.I've been working on articles on basketball coaches, which led to wanting  to see who will be in the American Athletic Conference next season, which led me to wodnering who wrote that well-researched article, so I decided to see who was working on it, which led me to you.I noticed that Sarah left you a note indicating she was involved with the Smithsonian; I have a to-do item to talk to someone abut the Terms of Use of the Smithsonian, so I think I will contact Sarah.I noticed you have a lot of interest in birds, and I'm trying to figure out how to respond to an OTRS email which involves birds, so here goes. Someone has provided an image that they believe are Ruddy Shelducks in Texas, and believes that is unusual. We aren't, as you know, into OR, and simply reporting that this is a photo of the bird in Texas feels ORish. But I'm out of my depth, so wondered if you had some thoughts.(Talk) "	0|0|0|0|0|0
Sources people,no propagandaThe following comments have been deleted:The band promotes Croatian patriotism and ultra-nationalism, and sings about topics such as the love for one's country, family and religion, but also about the hatred of Serbs and Croatian social democrats. Dealing with such topics has made the band controversial. Perković has been known to openly promote Ustaša ideology because he wears black clothes, salutes in the corresponding way and had often openly supported the Ustaše and the NDH in his statements to the media. Ultra-nationalism?Ultra-nationalism means that you want to destroy everything that is not of your nation.While patriotism means that you love your own nation,but you respect others.Where in his songs does he promote hate to other nations?And no mentioning songs created in time of war against the Serbs,because it was the time of war.And only mention songs written by him.Not what he is accused of performing. Hatred toward SDP?Where?Name source.He is right wing,that si widely known.Of course he disagrees with their politics and he considers their politics bad for Croatia,but hatred? Reliable source please.Where does he promote openly Ustashe?Citation please.Because he wears black clothes?Are all rockers Ustashe?By this,rock 'n' roll is equal fascism.He is a rock singer,of course he wears black clothes.Salute he uses is an old salute of Croatian nobles,that existed long before Ustashe.Despite this, his statements confirming his support for the Ustaše actually outnumber his denouncements of this virtual NSDAP equivalent (he is noted to have publicly voiced his support for the NDH, in various degrees, to the media on at least twenty occasions). His credibility in these statements is diminished not only by this fact but also by the legal necessity to denounce any fascist movement in order to avoid further banning (or other legal action).Again,I see that this is already discussed.Feral is not reliable,its a tabloid.Only reliable newspapers should be used.And these quotations in Feral,while they may be true,there are no links to check the meaning,because they may be taken out of contest,and they could have totally fifferent meaning ii their original contest.This is not reliable.And one more question.A couple of months ago I translated two Perkovic's statements in Jutarnji list and Vecernji list.I've put relevant sources,links to that articles.And a picture was there also.Someone deleted all this without giving explanation on the discussion page.This is not what wikipedia is about.Any change must be explained.Shame on anyone who uses this kind of sneaky methods.	1|0|0|0|0|0

There's far too much talk and stagnation on Wikipedia — I've seen discussions go on for two years without a change being made — but I'll go so far as to say that Z.E. is much more than a range of cars by Renault as they are not ICE vehicles at all. They are EVs, a completely different class of vehicle. Renault is making an dedicated commitment to develop these EVs and bring them to market and the fact that two of the four current Z.E. vehicles are based on existing ICE vehicle bodies doesn't alter that fact. We'll see what Renault will announce next for Z.E. but according to Renault this class/range/whatever will only grow.	0|0|0|0|0|0

" Referencing Referencing on Wikipedia, thanks to its primitive interface, is a pain. There are a couple of ways to do it: one widely-used method is to simply copy and edit references from another article. The Meridian Hill Park article has a start on references: it's got a heading and a {{reflist}} template, so you're partways there already. There are some extant citations in the text, like{{citation |title=Roads to Diversity: Adams Morgan Heritage Trail |url=http://www.culturaltourismdc.org/sites/default/files/pdf/AMHT_English.pdf |author=Cultural Tourism DC |date=2005}} and {{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?node=cityguide/profile&id;=799601 |title=Meridian Hill Park: Sports and Recreation Locations in Washington, DC on washingtonpost.com's City Guide |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=2009-07-16}}. You can see that the references are framed by  (or ) and  in HTML-like markup. You use named references if you are going to use a particular reference more than once. When embedded in the text they'll cause notes to appear in the References section at the bottom of the page.In the top left of the edit window you should see a toolbar that has, at the left, a button that says ""Cite."" Clicking it will show a drop-down menu of citation references for web, news, book and journal references, which then leads to a form that you can fill out (not all forms need to be used), and will insert a formatted reference wherever your cursor happens to be in the text. Often, for book references, you can dispense with extensive context after the first reference, and just say Smith, p. 15 and go on.My main concern on the tone of the article is the use of intensifiers and adjectives in general, which is frowned upon in encyclopedic style. A certain dryness is called for, but there's an art to keeping just this side of plodding declarative prose. It's an interesting exercise. Perhaps not Joe Friday, more like Bill Gannon. Have a look at the citations policy for more: also verifiability and reliable sourcing are important. The policies on no original research is important, since Wikipedia is a tertiary source that relies on secondary published sources.I'm certain you'll have more questions, please feel free to ask.

"* EphBlog is a personal blog, and is not officially recognized by the college.  Its format is unique only in that the EphBlog name is generic and catchy enough to *sound* like it could be an official college blog.  I'd guess that the name is the only reason the blog has the readership that it does.  Regardless, the vast majority of content on EphBlog reflects the views of David Kane, whether or not he frequently implores others to participate more.  The subject matter may span ""all things Eph"", but the viewpoints certainly do not.  I don't think that this elevates EphBlog above the status of ""personal blog"", nor should it make EphBlog eligible for inclusion on this page."	0|0|0|0|0|0

"Hmmm, maybe it needs to be made more clear. It is about people withdrawing off of benzos including those totally off of benzos. I thought with it being in the withdrawal section people realise that it was referring to people withdrawing or withdrawn and recovering from benzos. It is not about the risks of mixing benzos and alcohol and enhanced side effects but is talking about replacing one cross tolerant drug with another cross tolerant drug, they work similarly in the brain so basically drinking alcohol is like staying on benzos and worse because alcohol is more toxic. Like a cocaine addict would need to be careful with say taking prescription ampetaimess, not quite the same as stimulants don't cause strong physical dependence but you catch my drift?

I noticed that the file's description page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the copyright status is unclear. If you did not create this file yourself, then you will need to specify the owner of the copyright. If you obtained it from a website, then a link to the website from which it was taken, together with a restatement of that website's terms of use of its content, is usually sufficient information. However, if the copyright holder is different from the website's publisher, then their copyright should also be acknowledged.As well as adding the source, please add a proper copyright licensing tag if the file doesn't have one already. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the  tag can be used to release it under the GFDL. If you believe the media meets the criteria at Wikipedia:Fair use, use a tag such as  or one of the other tags listed at Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair use. See Wikipedia:Image copyright tags for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.If you have uploaded other files, consider checking that you have specified their source and tagged them, too.

"user and talk pages, and their subpages, and other non-article pages that *no others have substantively contributed to* and whose existence does *not impact the project*, *may* be courtesy blanked or deleted.""'' But, with users who have been substantial contributors that doesn't seem to apply as 1) others HAVE substantially contributed to the pages 2) it may well have impact on the project. The only justification for this deletion would be IAR in exceptional circumstances of real-life privacy violation or harassment. If it isn't that, then there is utterly no basis in policy or consensus. The discussion on AN, which I link above, bears that out. Courtesy blanking is better in such cases. g It's only four talk pages. There's absolutely no need for crazy statements like ""Your deletion is improper"". We can get to the bottom of why the Mercury left and why he requested deletion, and deal with undeletion and courtesy blanking as soon as we know the full reasons behind the request.   I've tried to contact Mercury, but for the moment, I've undeleted the pages, courtesy blanked them and protected them from further edits. I can't see anything which would cause any problems for Mercury, but if he does request their full deletion again and cites privacy concerns, I'll look favorably on such a request.   (ec)Sorry, I probably over reacted. I'm fighting a larger war on routine deletions of talk pages and archives - and a general misunderstanding of the rtv, and what it allows. I believe that the deletion of usertalk pages of established users is only justified in exceptional circumstances of causing off-wiki difficulties (and, in such cases, IAR can be validly invoked.) If you are satisfied that, in this case, there are such circumstances, then I won't question your judgement or ask for details. However, you might perhaps consider whether selective deletion/oversight of offending posts, or courtesy deletion might be better. Having said that, I leave it with you - I'll say no more and I'll not contest whatever you finally decide. I'm going to take up the wider issue as a policy discussion (without naming you or this particular case). I've posted, in generalities, to the mailing list.

You are quite right that it is *usually* the underlying image that is copyrighted. If you make a perfect sketch or photograph of a Francis Bacon painting, that will be covered by the same copyright as the original painting. But for these coins, nobody owns the copyright to the actual coin. What the British Library claims is copyright over their picture of a coin. If the coin was two-dimensional we would just ignore them and add a  copyright tag. But because it is three-dimensional (so the lawyer said, but isn't an oil painting too then?) we can't do that. But we can sketch their photograph because the sketch is not going to be the same as the original picture. It certainly all seems very odd to me, but I am not a lawyer. I forgot to say that I got a copy of Rumble's book The Reign of Cnut but I haven't had a chance to read it yet so I can't tell you if it is going to be very useful.   (Talk)	0|0|0|0|0|0

For photographic lenses, I'd say go ahead and write an article at photographic lens and we'll just add links from lens and lens (disambiguation).

Alternately, we could just make lens a disambiguation page, and move the articles to lens (optics) and lens (photography).

"I could ask this on the project talk page, but I'm probably just misisng a few obvious things. Please let me know your thoughts on these: Via the AFC category pages, I've encountered a number of articles where the template states that they are NOT under review at this time. Is that a bug? I felt like it was wasting my time. Similarly, a few that had already been declined. I'm pretty ""up"" on WP policies (I've done thousands of edits, created a few articles myself, participated in consensus building and admin-assisted special ops, etc.). However, I'm finding it hard to deal with the Gnn reason codes and WikiProject templates. Any advice? Is this something that should really be in the script? What do we do with Sandbox entries that the author obviously never wanted reviewed, even though they are in a review status? I'm not sure how they got there to begin with. For example, I saw a page that was obviously intended to the User main page, once he got his broken English repaired, and it was far from complete, yet it somehow had come into AfC. Really don't know how. Any idea how it got to us? Or what to do about any such article in review?I did approve one article, but I'm not sure I did two things correctly for it. a) I did some minor, obvious content cleanup (extraneous headings on a stub, hide TOC on stub, move infobox to top). b) I saw some obvious connections to other stubs on the same subject (a book series). AFter I approved it, I edited the automatic message on the user's talk page and added some suggestions to create a comprehensive book list for the series and possibly to merge all the short articles into a single larger one. Were these two actions god, bad, or indifferent?If you think these questions belon in the project talk page, fel free. Honestly, I think this project is begging for a new-reviewer-FAQ. And maybe some screen-shot tutorial.   "	0|0|0|0|0|0

"Thanks for that link, showing that the new version is far, far better sourced than the old... to easily and properly support her meeting WP:ENTand WP:ANYBIO when the earlier, essentially unsourced, version did not. Had this new version been the one looked at by Sandstein back in 2010, I do not think it would have been sent to AFD in the first place. The last AFD's should have been (sorry) 'no consensus' with the instructions that the thing needed proper sourcing as a BLP. Toward the !voter's comments...  THF makes no policy-based argument, PinkBull was incorrect to assert that she had not won any major awards, and Benjar was incorrect to imply that someone could be notable ONLY IF the GNG is met.  A pity that the 2010 AFD did not have greater participation, and worse that I did not have the time back then to improve the article sufficiently so that those three might revisit to see their ""concerns"" addressed.

I believe that the article did say this, or at least used to. I have not checked recently however and it might very well have been removed or hacked up since this article seems to offend so many. I do not think it is valuable for me to defend it since there are so many Hindus here and only one of me and I would very quickly be overwhelmed. However, in the interests of mutual understanding, permit me to clarify a few things. Creation or origin accounts are only important in one minor branch of Christianity (I cannot speak for Islam). And there are in fact multiple books and multiple versions of the bible in Christianity-not as many as Hinduism perhaps, but in the hundreds for sure-all interpreted differently by different sects. This is how there come to be several tens of thousands of sects of Christianity. And it is true that some branches of Christianity will charge others with blasphemy for not agreeing with them, but again this is only true of a small segment. The difficulty rests in the rather visible and vocal minority causing trouble. I suspect similar things might be true of Islam as well.	0|0|0|0|0|0

You targeted me and turnabout is fair play.   Your potential future victims have the right to be warned.Contrary to what you and your esteemed colleges would have your prey believe, psychopathy is a common disorder.  We know what causes it and we have made significant inroads in treatment.  Med school does not screen psychopaths out.

If Hitler would have had a DIFFERENT attitude towards Rosenberg and his philosophy, THAT would have been noteworthy. The same goes for the quip about the U-boat crews.

" Editing problems Steer Wrestling Montanabw is making sweeping, unsourced statements - statements that he/she is presenting as ""facts that everyone knows, and thus need no sourcing"". Mbw's profile page indicates he/she is a horse person living in Montana. I think Mbw's is approaching the subject with a proprietary bias and simply does not want a researched, documented ""Animal Abuse in Rodeo"" controversy presented. Mbw is minimizing my contributions while maximizing his/hers. Mbw is very slightly altering my contributions to reflect a ""this is an animal nut"" statement sort of thing. In one contribution I named a veterinarian with work in rodeo and included her credentials and her professional observations. Mbw reduced the contribution to ""a spokesman for an animal rights group."" So how come you are supporting someone who is actually damaging the article, and coming down hard on someone who is trying to improve and cover all the bases in the discussion? You should be telling Mbw the same thing you are telling me  if you don't want your material to be heavily edited then don't contribute. Mbw is minimizing the Animal Abuse Controversy (which is a valid point in the article and has its own little section within the article) in order to sell her pro-rodeo agenda  claims of being neutral and balanced notwithstanding. IMO, Mbw should be balancing my points with his/her own researched and documented points. Not ""editing"" mine to reflect his/her point.

Citations? Some wikipedians feel that lists should have a citation for each member in the list.

As long as every member is covered by a general reference then that is fine. This is mainly used to cover lists from books where every individual reference is to the same two pages in a book.

This is the text about D. in 1911 Encyclopedia:DOBRUDJA (Bulgarian Dobritch, Rumanian Dobrogea), also written DOBRUDSCHA, and DOBRUJA, a region of south-eastern Europe, bounded on the north and west by the Danube, on the east by the Black Sea, and on the south by Bulgaria. Pop. (1900) 267,808; area, 6ooo sq. m. The strategic importance of this territory was recognized by the Romans, who defended it on the south by Trajans Wall, a double rampart, drawn from Constantza, on the Black Sea, to the Danube. In later times, it was utilized by Russians and Turks, as in the wars of 1828, 1854 and 1878, when it was finally wrested from Turkey. By the treaty of Berlin, in 1878, the Russians rewarded their Rumanian allies with this land of mountains, fens and barren steppes, peopled by Turks, Bulgarians, Tatars, Jews and other aliens; while, to add to the indignation of Rumania, they annexed instead the fertile country of Bessarabia, largely inhabited by Rumans. After 1880, however, the steady decrease of aliens, and,the development of the Black Sea ports, rendered the Dobrudja a source of prosperity to Rumania.	0|0|0|0|0|0

":Uh, I didn't say he's white. I was merely commenting on his color. He's not as light as most Mediterraneans, but he's around the skin tone of the stereotypical Mediterranean (i.e. very tanned skin color). There are Ethiopians who are as light or lighter than him, but they are very few in number, so I wouldn't say that he's darker than ""a lot"" of Ethiopians. I would put those at or around his skin color at 10% tops, with those lighter than him much less than that. However, the pictures that you linked to seem to have bad lighting, which is why he appears darker than in other shots. If you look here, for example, you'll see that he's not actually that dark. He is, however, darker than most Mediterraneans. There are, however, many Egyptians who are darker than him and closer to Sadat's skin color. (Yom) | contribs • Talk "	0|0|0|0|0|0

" 4 November 2015 Your edit to Matt Bevin claimed that the information provided was ""biased"". It's not ""biased"" to tell the blatant truth. Matt Bevin was criticized for lying about his position on health care – there's no pretty way to say it. If the statement is deleted, like you had done, then it's hiding the truth, or whitewashing. Whitewashing is dishonesty and deception, which is unbecoming of a civilized person.

"As I say, you can't read English closely and this generates numerous misprisions in your understanding both of sources and what others say.A pointer, one of many possible ones, on how not to construe elementary English.I am completely indifferent to whatever geneticists say about history, unless they are practiced historians.(a)does not allow you to infer, and repeatedly say, that the meaning is: Nishadani clearly stated that are not familiar with population genetics, nor they believe in that science.'Where in that sentence do I state that I am unfamiliar with population genetics, and disbelieve that discipline? I am saying nothing about genetics: I am stating my scepticism about geneticists stepping outside their discipline to make arguments about another discipline, namely historiography. Peer-reviewed geneticists have RS credibility as geneticists, not historians, as peer-reviewed historians have RS competence as historians, not geneticists. Sometimes you have dual competence, as with C.D. Darlington, or Jits van Straten, but the geneticists you cite, if you check the historical books in their bibliographies, use dated or unreliable sources for their history, and make frequent errors, as many reviews have shown.(b)'You protest my writing:'What geneticists define as 'Jewishness' in Europe relates to male founder genes' and call me a racist who insults Jews.Here you fail to understand what geneticists define as 'Jewishness'. I am not using that language, the view is not therefore mine. If you have a problem with this take it up with Harry Ostrer, whose work you keep citing, or with experienced science reporters who report him saying that markers on the DNA reveal ""a biological basis for Jewishness,""..Reflect on this. You keep screwing up the obvious meaning of sentences. It's a reportable offence to do this when one of the consequences of your failure to understand my English is that you imdulge in wildly false accusations that a reasonable editor, making reasonable remarks, is an antisemite.

A spokesman for Itsy Bitsy Entertainment Co., who licenses the characters in the United States, said it was just a magic bag. ""The fact that he carries a magic bag doesn't make him gay. It's a children's show, folks. To think we would be putting sexual innuendo in a children's show is kind of outlandish.""3/ In an incident reported in 2000, a girl's Tinky Winky toy reportedly said ""I got a gun"". Kenn Viselman, then chairman of the Itsy Bitsy Entertainment Co., claimed the toy acutally said ""Again, Again"".

For me, ""devoré"" is the term that most fashion/textiles people use or know, although ""burnout"" is also used quite often for the same process. However, I would suggest burnout (textiles) is preferable to the current Burnout (clothing) title of the other page if ""burnout"" is deemed more appropriate than ""devoré"". They certainly need merging, although the question is, should Devoré or an alternative Burnout page with a more appropriate title be the new home for the information?

Below is the entire message I sent Rianna which you conveniently altered. Further, Rianna knows full well she asked for a change to the get site today because the article had not been edited for three days. She asked to change a couple of lines relating to Ms. Bruker and to remove the fact that she had an affair because it was not relevant to ths issue.  Bruno then denied her change. This was in the history of edits secions which I somewhere have saved.  Nishkid then changed the history section to show Rianna's change without the notice of line was changed. This is fraud and if an attorney did this in Federal Court, he would be disbarred and possibly charged with contempt of court. In response to Nishkid's question in the email to me, I think that he is not telling the truth and is equivocating about what Rianna really sent to her. From what I have read on her page, she would be quite offended at the vindictive behaviour of these men.

"Are we going to start quoting single phrases from policies in isolation now? For example, I can argue that WP:UNDUE also states, in the very first sentence, ""as far as possible without bias.""

I can also point out that strive is closely synonymous with try, which implies the possibility that one might fail under some circumstances (yet more evidence of room for common-sense).

BringItBringIt is a video gaming website that provides “gamers” the opportunity to connect over the internet and play one on one or multi-player tournaments against each other for money. The site was launched in November 2008 by Woodrow Levin.In addition to the gaming provided, the website allows users to blog, create profiles and write reviews in the forums.  BringIt includes the following platforms: XBOX 360, PS2, PS3 and Wii.  The main page also provides gamers with a list of the games the website supports.BringIt’s main page allows auto matches or allows gamers to select an opponent who is looking to play a specific game for the same dollar amount.  Players identify each other by their “gaming tag”, an online ID, and utilize their console’s online multiplayer platform or the built in multiplayer function of the game to play each other. When the game is completed, both players report the outcome to the website, or in the alternative result, emails are automatically reported from the game’s End of Game Email Reporting System. Winning players then have their account credited.  Founder/Chief Executive OfficerWoodrow H. Levin founded InStadium and Riverbank Capital Management. Woodrow has been featured in Media Life Magazine, The Chicago Tribune, and has been a guest speaker at the University Of Wisconsin School Of Business. Woodrow received his B.A. in Business from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and his Juris Doctor from the Chicago-Kent School of Law. Woodrow is active in community and charitable organizations including JUF, Lynn Sage Breast Cancer Foundation and most recently was on the executive committee of The Chicago Green Tie Ball.How BringIt WorksAll new gaming consoles and many older consoles are able to connect to the internet for multiplayer online game play. Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo game consoles all have built in software which allows owners to play online against other gamers anywhere in the world. Each game will then be played through the existing technology of the console or game maker. Our MissionBringIt is an online community where gamers across the globe can play video games for real money.  BringIt is a community of American and International gamers with the ability to play against each other 24 hours a day 7 days a week for real money.Legal AspectsBringIt is not in any violation of any United States or International anti-gambling laws currently in place. The reasoning behind this conclusion is that playing video games online are not games of chance; rather they are games of skill. Games of skill are not in violation of the Internet Gambling Regulation and Enforcement Act of 2006.  Users are required to be at least 18 years of age. Certain US State laws prohibit skill based game play and these residents may not compete in BringIt’s skill based video game tournaments.Games which may be played through BringIt’s website for real money include:Burnout ParadiseCall of Duty 4Call of Duty World at WarCOD4Dead or Alive 4Fifa 2009Fight Night Round 3,4Forza 2Gears of War 2Guitar Hero World TourHalo 4Halo WarsMadden NFL 2010Mario Kart MLB: The Show 2009MLB 2K9NBA 2K9NBA Live 2009NCAA Football 2010NHL 2009Rainbow Six Vegas 2Resistance 2Rock Band 2Socom: ConfrontationStreet Fighter IVSuper Smash Bros BrawlThe King of Fighters 12Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2010UEFA EuroUFC Undisputed 2009Unreal Tournament 3XBOX Live ArcadeReferences:betfromanywhere.com- http://www.betfromanywhere.com/blog/tag/bringit/BlogWogo.com- http://www.blogowogo.com/blog_article.php?aid=1815823&t;=5Bungie.org- http://nikon.bungie.org/news.html?item=24563centredaily.com- http://www.centredaily.com/business/technology/story/977193.htmlCnet.com- http://news.cnet.com/8301-17939_109-10105324-2.htmlCosmosGaming.com- http://www.cosmosgaming.com/news.php?id=21113730&tablespec;=november2008CrunchGear.com- http://www.crunchgear.com/2008/11/21/bringit-lets-gamers-put-their-money-where-their-mouth-is/Edge- http://www.edge-online.com/blogs/bring-it-onESPN- http://sports.espn.go.com/espnmag/story?id=3725594examiner.com- http://www.examiner.com/r-3879049~BringIt_lets_gamers_put_their_money_where_their_mouth_is.htmlFast Company- http://www.fastcompany.com/blog/sherri-l-smith/high-wire/gimmick-or-geniusFinancialcontent.com- http://studio.financialcontent.com/Engine?Account=wspa&GUID;=7237763&Page;=MediaForbes.com http://www.forbes.com/businesswire	0|0|0|0|0|0

I never put up with your attitude before and I won't now. I'm not the only person who thinks you've used ANI like a farce and it should stop.

Woody Allen I see that you have pointed out that you are an admin.  This is good.  However, your handling of my edit to Woody Allen was heavy handed and quite clumsy.  I will point out that good admins attempt to call on a different admin to assist them when they are in a conflict with a non admin, such as myself.  I now understand your point about the first sentence.  I just went out and found a reliable source for Ronan's comment in the second sentence.  Ronan's comment is notable (in hundred's of waysespecially since he is the only biological child of both Allen and Farrow).  I understand that I should not have put back in the first sentence, but on the other hand your edit was wrong.  Yes, I know you are an admin and as a good admin you want my constructive feedback to make Wikipedia work better (and I'm sure that Jimbo would agree that my feedback to you will make Wikipedia better).  You should have only removed the first sentence (because it was not supported by a RS) which is how it ultimately turned out.  However, for whatever reason you decided to remove the whole section that another edit placed in the article, including the direct comment of Ronan Farrow, Allen's only biological child.  That was heavy-handed editing.  The quote is notable.  Yes, it was initially placed in the article, by another editor, with the support of a non-RS; however, it is all over the Internet.  It is quoted by literally hundreds of RS's and you should have left in the quote in the second sentence and found a RS to replace the non-reliable source.  That would have been the correct way to handle the situation.  I hope my constructive feedback will be helpful to you in the future.  I fully expect to hear from you I'm just not sure if it is going to be positive or negative, but I do expect to hear from you.  Let me just point out that not every edit that an admin does is perfect, but of course I'm sure you already knew that! Have a good day!	0|0|0|0|0|0

"I do not ""hate"" Columbia College; I hate seeing students waste their time. Here's a fact: Columbia College is unranked by U.S. News and World Report and by other major publishers of institutional rankings. This is because it is open-admissions. There's nothing wrong with Wikipedia publishing an article on this school. There is something wrong with not mentioning the problems of an open-admissions art school, and there is something even more wrong with the grossly commercial discussion of its gift shop. Wikipedia is not a brochure.  Being the largest art school in the country is not a mark of distinction. In fact, the fundamental problem with Columbia College is related to the quality it touts: it's big. It's big because it does not limit its enrollments. There is a reason for that. It's not because it warmly and fuzzily and democratically embraces people from all walks of life. If it did, it wouldn't be so expensive. It does not limit its enrollments because it wants as much tuition money as it can get. Now, the members of its administration, its PR department, and its faculty are very careful to do everything to avoid this reality: in order to make art, one needs talent. Talent is, by definition, inborn and innate. You don't get it by acquiring skill. You don't get it by purchasing the most expensive camera, or the most expensive education money can buy. You're born with it, and by late adolescence, if you've got it, it will make itself apparent. Therefore, any student who actually has talent should strongly consider applying to a closed-admissions art school, one that requires a portfolio or other demonstration of work. These schools are also very expensive, but it's possible to get various kinds of financial aid. Once in the program, the talented painter, photographer, writer, or what have you will be surrounded by other talented students. That creates an entirely different atmosphere, one that keeps the student on his or her toes, as it were, and provides a sense of proportion and a sense that other students might be better. You might wonder why such an admission process demonstrates talent. It's because talent does not hide itself: it is apparent to experts in the field. There are two ways in which Columbia covers up this fact: by telling students that if they're showing up and willing to pay big bucks, then they're talented. It's easy to pass off that notion on a generation of kidsactually two generationsbrought up on the consumerist notion that he or she (and it's usually a he) who buys the most expensive camera has the most talent. The other means at Columbia's disposal is that for the last thirty years, children have been taught that self-esteem is the most important quality they can develop. In a misguided attempt to develop a false sense of self-esteem, schools have simply stopped talking about talent. They might, at times call it merit, but that, too, is a bad word. So an entire generation has grown up thinking that if you have the ""drive to succeed,"" you'll succeed. The problem: what if you've get the drive to succeed, but reaching down within yourself, you find you've got nothing to express?If you think Columbia loves you, try falling behind on your tuition. Good luck."	0|0|0|0|0|0

Minor League baseball players are under contract with a 'Professional' team, having to be stored in lower class teams, but still 'professional' players with stats. These type of minor league stub can further knowledge of the player by fans in the seats (with Blackberries etc, thus more webhits) or team scouts. WP:ATHLETE and 'people of notability' doesn't take into account that a 'player' and a 'person' of notability are two different things.  A 'person' is vague to define. A 'player' of notability, say a minor league baseball player, does have stats and awards to his name sometimes, and these stubs can add perfectly to what Wikipedia was meant to be in the first place!

There is no reason to treat AFF and SF the same. The neutrality policy, which explicitly states that it is not to be confused with “all views deserve equal time no matter how many or how few people hold them”, certainly requires nothing of the sort – look it up yourself, I won’t do your homework for you. Moreover, the merits of AFF and the merits of SF are two entirely separate and independent things. No amount of slamming AFF – even if your charges are accurate, which I doubt as your behaviour here strongly suggests your perceptions on such things cannot be trusted – can ever, by itself, make SF worth including. SF must stand or fall on its own merits.There are many serious strikes against including SF, none of which you have even tried to address. First of all it borders on being a blog, which is already an almost-decisive point against it (there was talk of banning links to blogs entirely at one point though it isn’t actually policy to do so as far as I know – certainly “it’s a blog” has stood uncontested as sufficient reason for deleting links on many pages, including the same one we’re fighting over). Equally importantly, having read parts of SF... though I do not myself agree with the characterization, I can see why others have gone so far as to call it a hate site. To be blunt, it's largely the chronicle of one person's persecution complex. As I said elsewhere, it verges on conspiracy theory in the kookiest sense. And then there is the painfully bad prose and screechy hysterical tone most of it is written in – it is simply not in any way a quality site and would not be even if I could credit the actual content. These three points – heck, any two of them – are sufficient reason leave the link off Wikipedia.And I haven’t even mentioned the most important reason yet. Your site simply is not notable. As far as I can honestly tell, you are the only person on Earth who considers it an important site. If it was worth linking to, someone other than the site's owner would have done so by now, or at least spoken up in favour of such. That last part, at least, is well-documented Wikipedia policy; look it up yourself as I once again refuse to do your homework for you. I am sorry – sort of – if some of this comes across as harsh. Though you will no doubt characterize this note as a personal attack, it is not intended as such (and compared to some of the things you’ve posted about others, including me, it’s not even close to qualifying as one). I wish only to lay out as clearly as possible why there is little hope of SF being linked from that or any other Wikipedia page.	0|0|0|0|0|0

I'm not sure what the rule is on that score, actually. Looking at the German barons category there seems to be an even split between those with Freiherr in the title and those without. Considering most of his life was lived in a German republic I would be more inclined to leave his title out but if somebody else wants to include I wouldn't mind. For me though, leave it the way it is, for the sake of convenience as much as anything. I'll look for a reference later on.	0|0|0|0|0|0

Will and Elizabeth's relationship Someone keeps removing text I write that Elizabeth is angry at Will after it is learned that he made a secret bargain with Sao Feng. The point in the last two movies is that it remains doubtful until the end whether or not they can overcome their differences and be together. At first Will believes Elizabeth loves Jack, then he's upset that Elizabeth did not confide in him that she was responsible for Jack's death. In a reverse scenario, Elizabeth feels betrayed that Will secretly made a bargain with Sao Feng, violating her trust and putting the crew in danger. She becomes even more estranged from him because of this. It is not until the movie's climax that the audience learns if they will overcome their differences and love one another (although they are again torn apart).	0|0|0|0|0|0

Hi Elen, apart from chewing your ear for the first deletion tag I have generally seen your own actions as even handed and I would extend this comment to a few of the other editors, all who disagreed with my view but after seeing how Wikipedia works internally I confess to being little else than disgusted at the sheer stupidity involved and I point that criticism at the mechanics of the successful removal of the page stub for JWASM I bothered to write for Wikipedia. The same antagonist tried to trash the MASM page that I rewrote earlier and from his comments in its talk page it is only a matter of time until he does it again. An earlier editor tried to get some content into the MASM page by scouring the MASM32 web site and linking to web pages that I wrote for the masm32 user base and while I was willing to tolerate this and did a reasonable amount of work on the MASM page to try and get it up to date and relevant so it was no longer needed, in the face of endless obstruction I will simply resolve the problem from outside Wikipedia. You are correct in the idea of taking the bat home but it goes further, pulling the stumps and taking the ball and stumps as well then ploughing the field and leaving the mess for the antagonist to clean up.

" Ka Sesotho Kgotso, ntate McDonald.Thanks for your input at the Sesotho talk page. I guess it really does depend on one's experiences but I do believe that there are numerous rational justifications to use the names ""Sesotho"" and ""Basotho"" (eg. ambiguity of ""Sotho"" which could refer to half a dozen different things) but I feel that the most important reason is that one should use the original form of the native name instead of arbitrarily modifying it (especially for a name which is not commonly used by average English speakers).I am rather intrigued by how you peace corps guys manage to learn these languages so quickly and be able to use them in the countries.What exactly do the peace corps do, exactly? Judging from the film ""eLollipop"" it appears that it's mainly an international volunteer organisation that goes to poor countries to attempt to uplift the people at grassroots level  which sounds like a lot of fun (yes, I probably SHOULD take a look at the Wikipedia article and stop asking you this stuff).

No, no, no - you have a right logic in your head but it is more complex than that.

It used to be dependent on an official (as well as immigrant giving the country of origin).

It is virtually impossible to have an article that is factual and also presents a view that the Danes are victims of Muslim invaders, because the facts do not support this. You have a bias towards a sanitized version where the DPP is just a conservative party, and then you and your co-horts choose to delete their racist statements made in Parliament and just about every fact that makes Denmark look bad.

" Examples ""Bitcoins can be exchanged between any two computers, provided each computer has bitcoin software and a wallet file. Some websites maintain wallet files (and bitcoin software) as a service to their users, allowing users to send and receive bitcoin even if they do not own a personal computer. No intermediate financial institution or government is required to verify transactions or transfer funds.""The above is not acceptable mainly because bitcoins are not solely exchanged between computers. That is not how the system operates entirely and it's in fact and understatement to the networking technology. A bitcoin transaction is simply signing the bitcoin address of another and transferring the coins. You can do that with any device. The website statement is misleading and implies people are trading bitcoins out of a library. That is not why these websites exist and you will need a citation for that claim.

"I had nearly moved on when I felt completely compelled to comment on this statement ""probably better than most clan websites, which tend to be based on long outdated stuff from the 19th century. Then I do not see a problem in using it until a better source can be found. Especially to make amends to the masses of unsourced information that is found on so many of the individual clan articles"". I can only interpet this as something is probably better because it is newer?? This makes no sense to me. History is what it is, it should not change for the sake of change. If it was accurate over 600 years ago, it is just as accurate today. Again, if something is true and accurate hundreds or even thousands of years ago, it is not and should not be subject to change because someone decides to re-write it for either personal gain or an agenda. That is exactly what has happened with the origins for many Highland Clans. For any that might be interested, William Skene's and John Murray's collaboration of The Highlanders of Scotland: Their Origin, History and Antiquities is a wonderful and refreshing read. This is more than likely the truest accounting for several of the Highland Clans. It asserts that many of the origin claims put forth in more recent times are attempts to gain a foothold on the Chieftainship, by usurping the rightful lines. You'll find that cadet septs used this technique to basically try to re-write history for their own selfish gain. You'd have to read the book to see how this played out but as I said before, nearly ALL of the Highland Clans being ""bastardized"" as Norman/Anglo-Horman/Flemish, etc. are really Dalriadan and Pictish mixes. Examples would be Campbell, Cameron, Grant, Davidson, Wallace, etc. I of course have distant YDNA connections to ALL of these surnames, but I know no one wants to hear about that as any sort of evidence. I'll admit not one of these surnames or clans has a pure lineage, but they all have a lineage going back to the Picts and Gaels. I am of that lineage, which is quite rare and continues to be established. The masses are not of that lineage, they are a mix if R1A1, other R1B haplotypes, the I haplotypes, etc. I will be the first to admit there may be hundreds of families, not even related through a shared male ancestor, sharing a surname or Clan. My concern is with the origins only, and the original Chiefly lines. And please don't tell me how we are a mix of so much dna, I am only referring to YDNA, the male lines. I am not talking about MTDNA nor Autosomal. What I don't understand is why when there is so much sourced information out there, some editors choose only to use factually inaccurate ""sourced"" information. There is substantial ""factually accurate"" sourced information out there however it is not my intent, to correct these erroneous articles or to present an ""opposing view"". There is no opposing view, there is either the truth, or their are lies. Either the Celtic version is correct, or the Comyn version is correct, or neither is correct. There can't factually be multiple versions of an origin, it is what it is and there is only one true origin. This is not a contest to see who can provide more recent sources. I would hope wikipedia would want the truth out there, and not contests of who can out edit who, which is what wikipedia appears to be. There, my case is presented to the message and not a specific messenger. Clan Davidson is Celtic, it descended from Celts and it has no connection to the Comyn family. It did not descend from a Comyn male. They came from a very ancient Gaelic ancestor, an ancestor shared by several Highland Clans, before surnames even were in use. One other greatly incorrect update to this site was the battle alleged between the Davidson's and the MacPherson's....this never happened. The battle was between the Clans fighting for the Chief of the Clan Chattan, the battle was fought between the Mackintoshs and the MacPhersons.The MacPhersons were the true chiefly line, but were ""out-documented"" by the usurping Mackintosh. This is pretty much exactly what is happening here, on this very page. I hope someone else has more time and energy to properly update this page with the correct information and let's bury the lies and factually inaccurate information comprising most of this article. It was originally much more factually accurate, but over the course of time has been corrupted with sourced information that is not also factually accurate."	0|0|0|0|0|0

Hi Looie496.Thank you for advising me of this. Appreciated. I really do love Wikipedia but I must insist that I'm allowed to love it on my own terms because I can do no other (or go without, which I candidly admit is the fate of most of my love affairs oh dear ...).As I think I must surely have made clear I really do have nothing further to add to the comments about 'Buddhist sex abuse cases' I have already made. I do hope the page is restored.Currently I'm fleshing out the biographies of  Leveller women. I've already supplied a stub for Katherine Chidley and I'm presently working on one for User:Rinpoche/Mary Overton wife of Richard Overton. It will take a few days before it's ready yet.Mary Overton was subjected to appalling abuse at one point in her life. She was nursing her new born baby when baillifs came to escort her to Millwall prison in London,an absolutely dreadful place. She refused so the bailiffs then called for some carters to take her away. They too refused out of common humanity. The bailffs then physically dragged her clutching her baby through the mire and dirt of the London streets while people spat abuse. Well I don't know but I think it quite possible that some of them went as far as telling her to 'go fuck yourself' which is absolutely frightful of course. The baby died some six months later.Regarding the BSAC debacle what I've done with my Katherine Chidley stub is that on the talk page I've added at the top a section for contributors in which I myself, as a contributing editor, expressly ask people to contact me on my talk page if they have any issues with it; the lack of a definition for the term 'controversialist' for example which I can see might be a real no brainer for users of a certain disposition. I'll be doing the same in all future new pages I contribute in the hope of avoiding the same difficulties I had with BSAC (assuming of course that's okay with the wiki community).Thank you for your attention.	0|0|0|0|0|0

" I'm sorry but you are factually WRONG.  As an Automotive Engineer, with a keen interest in vehicle dynamics, I can assure you that traction control and EDL are operate in two very different methods.  All traction control systems monitor differential axle wheel speeds comparing the driven axle to the non-driven axle - any differences outside the scope of the allowed tollerances will ONLY result in either (a) BOTH driven wheels on the same axle being braked, or (b) the engine ECU reducing engine output, or (c) a combination of (a) and (b).  EDL does NOT compare differences between front and rear axles, it ONLY compares differences between the left and right wheels on the same axle, and brakes just ONE wheel, there is NO engine power intervention.  Whilst they are both ""add-on"" functions of modern ESP systems, and use the same related hardware and electronics, the software control of the two different systems are distinctly separate, and help moderate/control different aspects of vehicle dynamics.  Don't forget, Wikipedia articles are not considered valid references for other Wikipedia articles, so if you have read something contrary on another Wiki article, it doesn't automatically mean it is correct!

Sockmaster using proxy server to mask IP? Hey  I think Corbridge, a user you recently blocked for socking, might be using a proxy server to mask his IP to evade the block and avoid scrutiny. I don't know how to check that out, so right now all I have is a hunch. The IP is 96.232.12.109. Its also worth noting that one of Corbridge's previous accounts, InaMaka, accused another editor of masking his IP here so I'm pretty sure he knows how to do it. Point being, if you want to look into it, or just point me in the right direction, I'd certainly appreciate it.	0|0|0|0|0|0

" ""Jesus and Messianic prophecy"" Hey. I don't know if this is technically where I should be posting this; sorry if it's not.1) Fine, if ""retort"" isn't 100% appropriate then I'll use ""counter-argue""- that is the meaning I was trying to get across.But I think all your other points are too strict and therefore not in keeping with Wikipedia's guidelines or encyclopedia guidelines in general.2) You said: ""Christians retort that the messianic prophecies never specified a time-line for the Messiah's actions, and the New Testament, especially the Book of Revelation, detail how some of the prophecies will come to fruition later. . This is a bit vague and raises some questions. Which Christians? Where did they say that? How did they detail it? Can you reference it from a notable/semi-notable scholar?""First, I can't point to a place in the Old Testament where the time-line DOESN'T exist, you know what I mean? There is no Jewish time-line so it cannot be referenced. But the New Testament does have a Christian time-line, as detailed in the Book of Revelation. Now, which Christians hold to this belief? Essentially all of them- all that have a moderate to literal interpretation of the Bible, which is essentially all. Where did Christian authors detail this belief? In the Bible! How did they detail it? They wrote it in the Bible!!! That is why I made Bible references! Which scholar can I quote? How about John the Apostle, who wrote Revelation? Is one of the founders of Christianity an acceptable source on the subject?I find you taking objection to this equivalent to someone writing, ""Christians believe Jesus came back from the dead, as detailed in various places, including the gospels,"" and then you coming around asking for scholarly sources and not accepting Bible passages and asking, ""which Christians believe that?"". 3) You said: This includes Jesus ruling an earthly paradise after the apocalypse (Revelation 19-22). , although it does reference The Bible, if left alone, it sounds rather confusing. It also does not specifically reference a line from Revelation, nor does it reference which version of The Bible it quotes (King James, NIV, etc) which could mean a slight difference in the quote. If you want many specific Bible quotes then I'll put those in, and I'll list if its KJV or whatever. But I don't think that's required as my broad citation of Rev 19-22 does clearly explain exactly what I'm talking about, including a physical kingdom on earth, a messianic age of righteousness and so on. Just because I didn't dissect it and show a specific line for each point doesn't mean they aren't there- any interested reader can easily find them by reading those chapters.If I had written, ""The story of Noah's Ark is in Genesis 6-9,"" would you have deleted my entry and said its citation is too vague? Just because I didn't give a synopsis with ten references doesn't mean it's unworthy; just look it up! 4) What bothers me most is how this whole thing started when I tried to correct incorrect data on your site (the line that Christians don't believe in a physical resurrection). That line had NO references! So even if my references are vague they still trump the initial post, don't they? You can't delete my post for dubious citation then restore something with no references at all.5) I'm sure you'll disagree with me on this one, but most of all, I think that my contribution didn't need to cite ANYTHING as it is such common knowledge that Christians believe in Judgment Day, an age of peace etc. I feel like I'm in some kind of twilight zone defending this belief. It's almost as bad as someone posting, ""Christians don't believe Jesus was tried, executed and came back to life,"" then I post that they do, citing Luke 20-24, then you saying that it is too vague etc. It was pure courtesy to give the citation- it's such common knowledge that Christians believe these things!But whatever- I'll repost with a several more-specific quotes. And BTW, you may think, ""Whoa, this guy care WAY too much about Wikipedia (and I'm a mod),"" but this is about preventing my religion from being misrepresented.

" Saint Peter's Tomb OK, the Catholicism tag is part of the Christianity tag because of my trying to integrate all of them. The question of the Vatican City, Rome, and Italy is a good one. I can see having one ""Italy"" tag with a drop-down for Rome and maybe another for Vatican City, and personally think that would probably be the way to go. Unfortunately, my machine got stolen last night which is likely going to seriously damage my own ability to combine those banners. I don't think this machine even has the tildes to do a signature, so I'm going to have to tell you by hand that this is John Carter. What you might consider doing is asking the Rome project to become a subproject of Italy, or, if it is inactive, just merge the banners yourself.

Every single one of your ""pillars"" and ""policies"" has been violated in the article itself, the discussion thread, and the administration of it.

The result is an article that is just plain false. But, you see, this doesn't matter at Wikipedia, because at Wikipedia all truth is negotiable, when means it is politically determined. The good thing is that, aside from anything that happens at the Sanchez whitewash page, the world at large is onto you and your crew.

Evidently, from what I gather, he removed the unfavorable fact of Mason's having allegedly extended his middle finger in an obscene manner, as photographed by an AP photographer, upon the acquittal of his client, Casey Anthony in the infamous murder trial; I just attempted to restore this, which involves the work of another user, but I'm afraid he'll remove it again. It's an infamous incident, and it needs to stay in here.  Can you perhaps also lock the article, as I'm afraid it may be subject to further loss/vandalism; I'm a newbie, so I don't know how to do it.	0|0|0|0|0|0

"I've amended the section in question with a few further alterations. I still think the section needs work and will continue to work on it myself. My main reasons for putting the section in now is that the original section was primarily concerned with: a) the ""say/show"" distinction, which I think plays little or no part in the Investigations; and b) a formal distinction between sense and nonsense which is much less explicit in the Investigations (if there at all) than it is in the Tractatus.

"==WARNING: MEMBER THE WIKIPEDIAN GREEK NATIONALISTIC JUNTA. By User:Balkan ==There’s a well collaborated (London based) group of GREEK Wikipedia sysops/users that  has been spotted to  work systematically in full daily basis propagandazing ultra natioanalistic Greek POV, and distorting related articles. They intervene in any Balkan history and politics related  article, pushing Greek POV, launch edit wars,  and repeated reverts of  vandalized by them versions, permanent deletions, block users, merges and redirects to deletetion of undesired new articles. Their main target is to distort all articles lelated to  ISLAM, TURKEY, REBUBLIC OF MACEDONIA, BULGARIA, ALBANIA (CHAMERIA), THEIR MINORITIES IN GREECE AND THEIR HISTORY. They attack  every article criticizing Greece transforming it  to Greekish propaganda POV. They became maniacs in optimizing dark side of Greek history.They communicate each other by secret e-mails avoiding messages through their talk pages to avoid publicity. This group acting in a systematic way to revert articles, when one of member makes the limit of 3 reverts, one another continues with 4th revert to avoid punishment for violating 3rv rule.Furthermore they are suspected agents of Greek National Intelligence Service (E.Y.Π. Κυπατζήδες) and  believers of ultra nationalistic organizations of Greek “national interests”, as L.A.O.S. and Chrissi Avgi. They are also multiple sockpuppets and impersonators of their group members. They are all schizophrenics web vandals unacceptible to wikipedian community. Balkan history has labelled such people as GREKOMANS, a form of mental malignacy cited in Larousse dictionaries.

"Agreed. I amended the article after the chessbase article came out. I think it's only fair to report it, without endorsing or refuting the possibility that Topalov did, in fact, cheat. Dionyseus has never understood the difference between saying, ""Topalov was accused of cheating"" and ""Topalov cheated"", so it is possible that he will now delete my edit, arguing that Topalov didn't cheat. It's frustrating and time consuming, arguing with characters like that. And while I had plenty of passive support last year, I'd appreciate some more active support for inclusion this time around, should Dionyseus choose to make another big stink. Apparently, Dionyseus interprets neutrality as the censorship of negative information, no matter how factual. Of course, this is the same guy who, last year, edited Kramnik's article so that it started with a list of his match losses. Of course, I wouldn't want to infringe upon wiki's tradition of love, charity, and respect; so, I feel I should clarify my position insofar as I absolutely DO NOT regard Dionyseus to be 1) a blight on wikipedia, 2) a mental degenerate, 3) incapable of lucid reasoning, or 4) incapable of language use. He is certainly none of those things. And admins may take that as an official statement.  "	0|0|0|0|0|0

" Relation to gaming modules The first scentence of this article states that the book is ""based on a series of Dungeons & Dragons gaming modules."" but then nothing else in the article explains or expands on this connection. I would think this article coupld be improved by putting some information in on this. Which modules exactly? How closely does the book follow the modules? what are somethings in the book not I the games, and/or vice versa? Which characters were playable and which NPC's? etc. I was actively playing AD&D; at the time that Dragonlance was released, I did not play the DL modules but borrowed and read the novels off a friend. My recollection was the books and novels were developed together, though it does seem reasonable that the plots of the novels were based somewhat on the original playtesting of these modules. If this is the case some of the characters were originally played by noteable people, if anyone has info on this would be something interesting. -  "	0|0|0|0|0|0

"Oh hi. Long story short so I won't be ""ranting"" (or what not) this time:So Sjones is wikihounding me constantly for nearly a year now, and his pal Bridies is also obsessed with me to the point of where the great most of his entire activity here on Wikipedia in the 5 months was all about how to rid of me (while I've substantionally adited hundreds of different articles during the same period, over 5,000 in total since March 2012). That's just not normal. Btw, right now I'm blocked because I referred to this wikihounding by ""stalking"" (which is just semantics really, apparently they call it ""cyberbullying"" now outside the Wikipedia).Now, GAs. Basically what The Devil's Advocate wrote in his comment - and this example of the so-called ""additional evidence"" (as it was called by Sjones in his wikihounding thread) is indeed a good example of ""evidence"", as it shows what is actually this ""problem"" with me - and it's that I actually know (and obey) all the policies, rules and guidelines (including but not limited to everything regarding GAs and their reviewing process), while many reviewers don't know, and even when they're informed about the rules and guidelines (the proper ones, because in this case the reviewer was misinformed by some other apparently uninformed users, strangely including at least 1 admin) they might even flatly and completely refuse to acknowledge and use them (here, the reviewer's invoking ""ignore all rules"" instead of admitting the wrong). I'm all for proper reviewing, instead of incorrect/arbitrary, which is why I've opened this thread recently (aftter this very debacle, precisely) because the scale of this problem (various types of bad reviewing) is pretty alarming, and some reviewers' blatant refusal to play by rules after they're being informed about them is just absolutely unacceptable (that's my opinion, at least, but I can't see how could I be any wrong with being right).

" Question for Gwen Gale Gwen, I'm asking you this question mainly because of your frequent participation at this article and its talk page. Would you consider material presented from this source acceptable and helpful if used in a proper context? Thanks.   My question was asked in good faith. Perhaps you could find some time to answer it. Thanks.   The only answer I can give to an open question like this is, please do see WP:RS (it's where I'd look first if I had a broad question about a source). If you'd like further input on a given citation, lots of editors other than myself watch this page, you might want to post it here and see what that stirs up, that's what article talk pages are all about. You can also try Wikipedia:Reliable sources/Noticeboard, which at least may sometimes give one something akin to a further take on neutrality.   Thanks, Gwen, for getting back to me. Obviously others are welcome to give further input concerning the source I asked you about. I was curious as to what your opinion was regarding The Sun as a reliable source. I read an interesting article given by Rochus Misch there.   Misch himself didn't see everything and recall can get way fuzzy after six and a half decades, but he saw a lot nonetheless. Could you post a link to that article here? I'd be happy to read it. Thanks.   Sorry, Gwen, for the delay in getting back to you. I actually was hoping for your opinion about ""The Sun"" rather than about Misch. If I decide to add the information at some later point we might be able to discuss its relevancy at this talk page. For now, your opinion regarding using The Sun as a source would be appreciated.   I'm sorry, I had missed this. I would need to see the article itself. That said, I'd be wary of citing anything from the Sun without knowing who wrote it and how it was sourced by them. Moreover, if I found something in the Sun I'd tend to dig deeper and find a source on which one could more steadfastly lean. It's not that tabloids get things wrong (all newspapers botch details, all the time) so much as tabloids tending to over-spin stuff for entertainment, which is their slice of the market, in much the same way the Times and the Guardian spin heavily for politics in some topic areas. It all makes for sloppiness, through which a cite may, say, be ok as to WP:V but then skids into the ditch owing to WP:UNDUE.   I wonder if this relates. I would think it would be wrong to reference, edit, or dispute sources which are not at hand to be checked. Perhaps a person should only use information that they have read and can understand.  Wm, I doubt that only  ""using information that they have read and can understand"" would be the best criterion to use and be the most appropriate and helpful method in referencing an encyclopedia. Being partial to an exopedian version of this project (I do err from time to time myself), I think the inclusion of ""quotes"" and anecdotal reminiscences gleaned from border line tabloids should be avoided.   I lost you, but I’m confused myself. It appears as though the person with the least information available is most influential on the article.The U.S. is big on free press, and it works. My very low budget suburb is in a system which serves 225,000 people with 4 MILLION titles (numbers approximate, thanks Carol). That’s on the next shuttle van. Most of the rest of the assets of a state with 12 million people are a couple of days away by mail. The specialty stuff on AE from Radcliffe took maybe a week. And I am an amateur. Dan, you are over three million people higher in the food chain, you must be “world class”.

Ok, now you're just being a vandal. Retail software is not a topic, it's a label for computer software that is on retail. You also vandalised my edits which removed unencyclopedic information. It is for this that I know you have no interest in improvement, only in undoing my actiion. I repeat, unless you find a source that actually defines this as a topic and not the label it actually is, it will continue to be a redirect. Deleting referenced material I did not. I turned it into a redirect, and as it's a label and the source refers to the label of a very specific area of computer software which isn't a topic, it has no encyclopedic content to merge. -	0|0|0|0|0|0

"I've read through the above and I've looked up the article in question on the NEJM website.  is correct in saying he can make basic calculations without it being considered 'original research', but your calculation is not correct. The figures involve the median survival rates, not the mean rates and as such, simply subtracting one figure from the other produces an inaccurate statistic. The median survival rate is simply the middle point between the two extremes - so if one person died after one year and one person died after two years, the median survival rate would be 1.5 years, even if 99% of people died after 1.1 years. Therefore, your figure implies something that is not the case.The abstract explicitly states the following:This reduction represented a 4.1-month improvement in median survival (25.8 months in the sipuleucel-T group vs. 21.7 months in the placebo group).I think that if the survival advantage was 14.2 months, much more attention would be drawn to this figure, rather than the only figure to be highlighted of 4.1 months.

"::Describing the Jesus Bloodline as being linked to traditionalist ""esoteric Christianity"" will always exist without a citation and reliable and independent source. If Jesus Bloodline is to be linked to ""esoteric Christianity"" it needs to be emphasised that it is to an untraditional and modern version of ""esoteric Christianity"" that has been influenced by Margaret Starbird. And this can be easily done. There are ample internet sites that define traditionalist esoteric Christianity and this needs to be compared against the esoteric Christianity that was inspired by Margaret Starbird. Traditional esoteric Christianity that dates historically back thousands of years to Origen of Alexandria dealt with metaphysical matters. The common interpretation of Gnosticism widely held by maistream scholarship is that it was a dualist nature holding that matter was evil and rejecting the physical substance of Christ. This can be easily substantuated by reliable and independent sources from works published by mainstream scholars. It was the book Holy Blood and Holy Grail that was first responsible for twisting the idea that Gnosticism ""believed that Jesus Christ was a human being"", and this became uncritically repeated ever since by those who uncritically follow the modern concept of the Jesus Bloodline. Again, it can be very easily verified by citing scholarly books that the Jesus Christ of Gnosticism was not a physical human being. None of the comments here can be described as ""Original research"".   "	0|0|0|0|0|0

One of your contributions () is definitely extremely unbalanced und not tolerable, so there is a COI. Without this note, I would believe that this was intentional, but with your note, it seems that you are just missinformed by anti-OSS people like Eduard Bloch... Let me explain in detail: The text in the mentioned diff does not belong into the licensing section at all. It may be a candidate for the critisizm section on the Debian article (to explain problematic behavior of Debian against cdrtools, firefox, ...) after it has been corrected to reflect the truth. The named text tries to belittle cdrtools with false claims, so let me give the correct background information: All CD/DVD/BD drives ever made are SCSI devices. ATAPI is just one of many SCSI transport mechanisms and while ATAPI is fully integrated into the SCSI stack on Solaris x86 since 1993, this was not the case on Linux in 2004. This is a design problem on Linux. Cdrtools is highly portable to ~ 30 different platforms (not counting different CPUs separately) and the man page mentions that it grants equivalent behavior on all supported platforms The vast majority of all platforms do either not have device nodes at all or do not have a 1:1 relation between a specific device node and a specific SCSI device. Win-DOS and Mac OS X both do not have device nodes for SCSI devices, so 99% of all computers in the world cannot use device node based SCSI addressing. 3) and 4) make it obvious that you cannot use device nodes in a portable implementation and that only the official SCSI addressing scheme is portable across platforms. In September 2004 Linus Torvalds introduced a fatal Linux kernel SCSI interface incompatibility while claiming to fix a security bug. This incompatibility was introduced exactly when a new stable cdrtools relase was puiblished after a long time of bug fixing and code freeze in cdrtools. The patches from Debian (Eduard Bloch) that you seem to reference and that have been published in 2004 are full of bugs. In Spring 2005, there have been aprox. 150 unique bug reports against cdrtools  in the bug tracking systems of various Linux distros. Nearly 100 of these bugs have been a result of the patches from Eduard Bloch. The other 50 bugs have been fixed in the original code between September 2004 and August 2006 after Debian stopped updating their source. BTW: As there is no development activities on cdrkit since May 2007, the vast majority of these 150 bugs is still present in the defective and dead fork from Debian. In special, there is no code in the Debian fork that works around the SCSI interface incompatibility mentioned in 6). cdrtools is a really openminded project. Any patch that was send and that follows the quality requirements in the CONTRIBUTING rules has been accepted. The patches from Eduard Bloch did not follow the quality rules. The cdrtools project does not accept patches that harm the code - sorry, but this is needed if you like to give long term support for a program. Note that the first libscg code was written in August 1986 (28 years ago) and that I have other OSS (e.g. star) that is maintained since 32 years.This list of explanations can be found in the internet if you use a search engine...I did write it many times in similar wording in the past after people came up with similar false claims.Please also note that the fork from Debian was started in May 2004 - 10 years ago. When Debian claimed to start their cdrkit fork in late 2006, they did just change the name on my request. So this cdrkit includes all bugs that have been introduced by Debian since early 2004. Cdrkit did never publish a release that has no known bugs at the time of being published, so cdrkit did never raise above alpha-release quality.As your request looks collaborative, I am sure that you understand that you have been fooled by unfriendly people and fully remove the paragraph in question.	0|0|0|0|0|0

I am wondering, what is the notability of De Waal, to include him in a dozen (?) articles as the sole source for a claim. Has he written anything other than that work, in journals, or other peer reviewed publications about those specific years of history? So I concur with Vartan, and any neutral user can't do otherwise when De Waal has been used more than his notability would allow as sole source in countless articles. As he is a sole source, he can therefore be considered as having fringe position and removed unless Grandmaster or Atabek have any other works substantiating the personal opinions of De Waal who supports fringe positions in various issues including Shushi or the Armenian Genocide. The fact that he presents the Armenian Genocide as an Armenian position and compares it to a fabrication of the 60s of an alleged 2.5 million Azeri exterminated by Armenians alone would be enough to dismiss his position for that particular period of history. I'm afraid this time around, the adding of De Waal has reached the limit. This is not De Waal encyclopaedia to have his position on everything, especially when he is the sole source for the position he represents. -	0|0|0|0|0|0

I vividly remember my Elementry school days, when the other kids would shun me and not let me into their stupid little groups. The boys were all friends, as for the girls, they had two groups. One was the popular girls group, and the other was the unpopular girls group. You may think that I would at least have fitted into the unpopular girls group, but I didn't. They locked me out of their little group and wouldn't even talk to me. They teased me mercelessly and so did the popular girls group. I never got invited to any parties after 2nd grade; I never had any friends. The boys basically ignored me (until 7th grade when THEY were the ones who teased me mercelessly), while they flirted with the other girls. All the other girls would talk about was boys (when they weren't bragging to each other about thier home life). They never let me play with them, and the teacher didn't make them include me. In lunch and recess I would just sit alone or cry alone. In 6th grade one of the kids told the teacher to throw me out the window. The teacher just shook his head. Kids are cruel, and I will never, ever, NEVER forget the torture I endured as a child. Yes, I do think kids are buttheads.	0|0|0|0|0|0

Mercy, I have to disagree with your reasons. To me it seems you are nitpicking on the photo for no particular reason.  Even if other religious beliefs (Muslims, Jews, etc) are represented the reality is that they are a very small minority when compared to Christians. Why not just have a collage of a few congregation sites (churches, mosques, etc) and eliminate the gallery altogether. To go over your points.1)If Catholicism is the main religion then a Catholic Church should be prominently displayed.2?Why not just change the caption.3)What does it matter where the church is located? San Juan is after all the main population center. it's like talking about Italy and choosing not to display the Colosseum because it's in Rome.	0|0|0|0|0|0

This article has been reviewed as part of Wikipedia:WikiProject Good articles/Project quality task force in an effort to ensure all listed Good articles continue to meet the Good article criteria. In reviewing the article, I have found there are some issues that may need to be addressed, listed below. I will check back in seven days. If these issues are addressed, the article will remain listed as a Good article. Otherwise, it may be delisted (such a decision may be challenged through WP:GAR). If improved after it has been delisted, it may be nominated at WP:GAN. Feel free to drop a message on my talk page if you have any questions, and many thanks for all the hard work that has gone into this article thus far.GA review (see here for criteria):This article fails primarily on WP:LAYOUT; there are far to many embedded lists. The whole article is really just a collection of lists, with short sections of prose in between. Even the ""Programs"" section is really little more than a list disguised as prose. There are also major problems with the referencing; there are a great number of dead links, which I have marked, and there's an unfortunate mix of inline references and external links in the text.This is just the tip of the iceberg; I really don't think there is any way of saving this article without extensive work. Still, I will give it the normal week on hold, please contact me if anybody decides to rewrite it.   "	0|0|0|0|0|0

"STOP DELETING MY ADDITION.  You, Muboshgu/Mephistophelian say:Please do not use talk pages ... for general discussion of the topic. They arefor discussion related to improving the article. They are not to be used as aforum or chat. If you continue to use talk pages as you do, you may be blockedfrom editing. You are using the talk page to push a POV rather than addressingthe article in a constructive manner. Please stop.I AM NOT ""generally discussing a topic"", I AM NOT ""chatting"". I AM NOT   ""pushing a P.O.V."".  If you do not understand basic English grammar, you haveno business telling me anything.  FACT: commas are used in this context toseparate a list, a series, of related clauses.  Grammar is not a matter of a""general discussion"" or ""chatting"" or a ""point of view"".  It is a technicallyprecise set of rules, and in this case, a set of rules that demonstrate thatthe foundation of the issue is a fraud.  THIS IS NOT OPINION, IT IS FACT, ITIS RELEVANT TO THE ARTICLE, IT IS FOUNDATIONAL TO THE ARTICLE.  I AM TALKINGABOUT IMPROVING THE ARTICLE BY CLARIFYING THE FOUNDATION ACCORDING TO THERULES OF ENGLISH GRAMMAR AS ANY LITERATE PERSON CAN SEE.  AND I AM TALKINGABOUT ADDING THE RELEVANT AND FOUNDATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL CLAUSE.FROM TALK GUIDELINES (why don't you review them!): There is reasonable allowance for speculation, suggestion, and personalknowledge on talk pages, with a view to prompting further investigation.   make the extra effort so that other people understand you. Beingfriendly is a great help. It is always a good idea to explain your views; itis less helpful for you to voice an opinion on something and not explain why  you hold it. Explaining why you have a certain opinion helps to demonstrateits validity to others and reach consensus. Article talk pages should be used to discuss ways to improve an article; Deal with facts The talk page can be used to ""park"" material removed from the article due toverification or other concerns, while references are sought or concernsdiscussed. The talk page is particularly useful to talk about edits. New proposals for the article can be put forward for discussion by othereditors if you wish. Do not threaten people: For example, threatening people with ""admins you  know"" or having them banned for disagreeing with you. Editing  or even removing  others' comments is sometimes allowed. But you should exercise caution in doing so, and normally stop if there is anyobjection.As I previously posted here: THE ARTICLE SHOULD BE IMPROVED by making it clearin the opening statement that the entire issue is a fraud upon the publicsince there is no ""natural born citizen"" requirement that is applicable today.That is fundamental to an informative relevant foundation to the article, nota matter of opinion, and a matter of grammatical fact.If I say ""No animal except a mouse, or a rat, at the time I give the signal,shall be captured"", then I am saying only mice and rats shall be captured ATTHE TIME I GIVE THE SIGNAL.  My order has no validity at any other point in time.  Similarly, the requirement for ""natural born citizen"" only applied AT  THE TIME OF THE ADOPTION OF THIS CONSTITUTION.  It does not apply today, andthe following clause should be part of the article, since it is the clause atthe foundation of the issue in the article:No person except a natural born Citizen, or aCitizen of the United States, at the time of theAdoption of this Constitution, shall be eligibleto the Office of President; neither shall anyperson be eligible to that Office who shall nothave attained to the Age of thirty five Years, andbeen fourteen Years a Resident within the UnitedStates.209.112.188.15  "	0|0|0|0|0|0

Combining options 1 and 3Point taken about the importance of the ecological roots. Here's a re-working, re-inserting that:Sustainability, in a very general sense, is the capacity to maintain a certain process or state indefinitely. However, over the last 50 years or so in recent years the concept has been applied more specifically to living organisms and systems, and to humanity in general. As applied to the human community, sustainability has been expressed as This is sometimes expressed through the idea of meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.Sustainability requires that human activity only uses nature’s resources at a rate at which they can be replenished naturally. The term has its roots in ecology as the ability of an ecosystem to maintain ecological processes, functions, biodiversity and productivity into the future. There is now clear scientific evidence that humanity is living unsustainably by consuming the Earth’s limited natural resources more rapidly than they are being replaced by nature. Consequently, for many people, sustainability has come to mean a call for action, for a collective human effort to keep human use of natural resources within the Earth’s finite resource limits.Sustainability has become a controversial and complex all-purpose term  that is widely applied in many different ways: to different levels of biological organization (e.g.sustainable e.g.,wetlands, gardens, prairies, forests), to different levels of human organization (sustainable households, (e.g., ecovillages, eco-municipalities, sustainable cities) towns, sustainable countries) and to human activities and disciplines and more {e.g., (sustainable agriculture, sustainable architecture sustainable economics).I sure hope that this one passes muster for all.	0|0|0|0|0|0
Wikipedia's community is really just explaining how Wikipedia works. If the Wikipedia article is too big to describe such a fundamental concept as our editors.. then we should move other things to a second page if we have to. Separating the article just doesn't make any sense to me.The Wikipedia community can easily be defined by one's perspective and isn't something we can just tie down to some specifics. A separate article will likely encourage a false impression of what the community actually is.	0|0|0|0|0|0

"Is there any half-decent Cantonese pop music, or is it all treacle?  04:41 25 Jun 2003 (UTC)Is there really ""westerners"" listening to Cantopop?  I doubt the sentence ""To western ears,..."" is NPOV.The article fails to mention the composer 顧家輝, singer 仙度拉, and their song 啼笑姻緣 which overturned the preception that Cantopop as a second grade Music (i.e. for old uneducated person only).  And it was Sammy Hui who finally pushed Cantopop to overtake Mandarin pop as the music of choice for HK youths.  Yes no mention at all of the Gu Gaa-fai,Wong Jim collaboration. No mention at all of the popularity of TVB TV theme songs, while everbody else was sticking their own lyrics onto somebody elses music these two, seemed to be the only people producing original material.  I'll try to NPOV the article more, but I claim no responsbility on contentyou can't get much further from my musical domain than Cantopop.  05:06 25 Jun 2003 (UTC) No problem.  I bet you have the chance to listen to the most popular Cantopop songs but not the best.  I will get the same preception if I listen only to Madonna or Britney Spears.I didn't mean that I wouldn't like it.  I meant that I've never heard any, and I certainly don't know the history behind it, so my editing is limited to grammar and attempts at NPOV. )  05:23 25 Jun 2003 (UTC) Tones I heard that Cantonese music differs from Mandarin in that Mandarin respects the language tones in the melody, but Cantonese doesn't. Is it true?  Good Cantopops do respect the language tones in the melody, as all Chinese dialects are tone-sensitive. What you heard is a recent disaster in HK music, beautiful face is more important than singing skills and so songs become less important.  But there are still many real musicians care about the tones and the melody. Cantonese is more tonal than Mandarin.  Mandarin only has 4 tones for each pronunciation, but Cantonese has at least 6 tones according to most dictionaries.  Some author even claims there are 9 tones in Cantonese.  Even though written Chinese can be pronunced in Cantonese or Mandarin, but the sound differs so much that you cannot sing a Cantonese song in Mardarin nor vice versa.  Many popular tunes get both Cantonese and Mandarin lyrics which are totally rewritten and sometimes with unrelated subjects.   20:31, 25 Oct 2004 (UTC)Yes but Mandarin has a more pleasant rhythm when spoken with natural darkness and light and this translates into songs pleasnter on the ear.I've heard people talk about Cantonese as sounding like a machine gun on the ear. And, how do Cantopop artists deal with music piracy?   Cantopop artists deal with piracy using the same technique as European or American artists, i.e. virtually nothing they can do!!!  But I was under the impression that in HK and Canton, media piracy was much much higher than in Europe or America. But there still are Cantopop artists. Are the economic models different? Do they resort to corporate patronage? ...   Curious: How did you hear that ""height"" in Cantonese areas?  00:40 30 Jun 2003 (UTC) I meant South China in general, but it should affect Cantopop. My source is Slashdot . Ehem. I think I read something in Wired of Bruce Sterling finding dirt-cheap pirated media there, but I don't find it. I though tit was common knowledge.  You have some of the most popular cantopop stars e.g. Joey Yung and Twins going on TV and saying how poor they are and asking their fans not to steal their livlihoods.And yes they do resort to corporate patronage of a sort.In the Joey Yung interview I was referring to, she claimed that she was making no money on her albums, but that she still had to produce albums to keep herself in the public eye and maintain her fanbase. With a large enough fanbase she can make money on personal appearances and concerts.For example Jade Kwan has recently been booked by a chain of bars, in the mainland, for a dozen or so 20 minute mini-concerts.Furthermore if you are popular enough you can make money through endorsments.There isn't a single reasonably attractive female cantopop singer who isn't e	0|0|0|0|0|0

User:CCFSDCA Hi - I’m User:CCFSDCA (Christopher Corbett-Fiacco) and I understand the concerns expressed by many of you regarding the articles I’ve posted at Wikipedia the past week or so. I am in fact the author of The Whole World Calendar Book of Holidays Around the World, as stated (an as-yet unpublished book which is based upon the self-published The Whole World Calendar 2008 [and 2009; email me at wholeworldcalendar@gmail.com and I’ll be glad to send you a sample page and info on ordering, if interested]). I have sent Wikipedia its permissions grant for using copyrighted material as requested and assure you that I am not self-promoting. My mistake is in not yet spending the time to figure out exactly how to cite the book as the reference for the article, which I’ll do as soon as I have the time. My intent in adding the articles is that they are actual national/religious/cultural holidays and festivals, are therefore ‘newsworthy’ if not particularly important, and, having spent two years researching the topic, I can assure you that it is quite difficult at times to find such information  try to find out what Earthquake Victims Memorial Day is in Armenia and you’ll see what I mean. It is my intent to self-publish the book within 6 months if I cannot find a publisher. Meanwhile, feel free to delete my articles as desired. I’ll revisit the subject at a later date and repost them only after I’ve ascertained that I am, in fact, doing it right. Meanwhile, I’m not copying from somebody else  those articles are my own  that’s the way I write. Thanks much.   Chris Corbett-Fiacco	0|0|0|0|0|0

I think it is also necessary to focus on the conflict between Shah Ismail(he was 100% Turkish) and Yavuz Sultan Selim(Selim I.). The reason of this conflict was government policies. The Ottoman Empire used Sunni Islam as the state policy and Shah used Shiite Islam as the state policy. You can find more about this in the book called, History of The Ottoman State, Society and Civilization which edited by E. Ihsanoglu and in the book, pages between 27-31.	0|0|0|0|0|0

Deleting: Max Katsarelas It upsets me terribly that you found it necessary to delete a page created for Max Katsarelas.  You obviously didn't read my rebuttal to dispute the deletion. You display the insight of a 100 year old women that has suffered from Alzheimer's for 20 years. You don't even deserve a user page you PC using paper pusher.  I've said it once and I'll say it again- it's people like you, with little to no creativity and a desk job from 9-5, that get your kicks out on start up wikipedians. Your power is falsified and if ever one day something happens to the infrastructure of the internet, you'd be shit out of luck like a milkman in the 1980's. Additionally, why don't I tag your username for a copyright infringement? If it's true that you're a fan of The Simpsons, then I may never watch the show again knowing someone of your character partakes in the humor of Homer's comedic stylings.So as you probably read through this and decide you're going to delete everything I have just taken the time to write, I'd like to know a few things. 1. Do you have one of those computer chairs that has a toilet built in? If you did, I would understand why you were upset and tagged the article for speedy deletion- you had diarrhea. Aint it just the worse?2. Are you married or still living in your mother's basement? It was a little unprofessional for me to call you out for living in your mother's basement, because, hey, most wikipedians do anyways. However, the point is, if you spent as much time reading through the edits of wikipedia as you did chasing tail like a real man, I'm sure, in fact, 100% positive you would not have tagged Max Katsarelas' page for deletion. I think it's time you get some poon. You don't know what poon is?  Here you go, read about it.3. Do you put your wikipedia skills on your resume? Just curious.4. Do you have cyber with any of your fellow wikipedians? For the record, I will continue to post Max Katsarelas' page up because I have kept the copy I wrote and I want to prove to you and my fellow visitors of the page what little lives you wikipedians have.

"Also Sandstein, I hope you can explain how you came to reach the decision you did on whether the interaction bans were valid or not, because when one looks at it logically one can see that you have acted in defiance of your authority as an admin. But when one looks at what you did behind the scenes in conjunction with a certain editor at WP:IBAN is just the cherry on top of the icecream. During the AE report that editor adds this to the policy. You then amend it  the edit summary of your edit is quite amusing considering the conclusion you reached at AE. That editor then posts Wikipedia_talk:Banning_policy#Clarification_in_the_interaction_between_site_and_interaction_ban and he hopes ""it is non-controversial?"" Oh no, of course not, it is entirely uncontroversial to go and amend POLICY in the middle of an AE enforcement to ensure that a fellow EEMLer is let off without sanction. If this has happened once, chances are it's happened before right? It would indeed be interesting have a look at the previous appearances of Volunteer Marek at AE, and see if he got off without sanction as a result of deceptive shit going on in the background. I know of one occasion it did; on that occasion Piotrus went running to Newyorkbrad and wikilawyered his EMML buddy out of yet another block. It is for that reason, upon seeing that occur, and my block being left intact, that I sent Arbcom a number of emails to ask them what the fuck they were doing. Would anyone like to have a look at other instance, and see if that held true, and who the AE closing admin was. I know the AE from last year didn't see any possibility of Piotrus getting VM out of the shit; but instead, several days into VM's massive two week block (don't worry VM, it will be an indefinite block for you soon enough), Piotrus goes and awards VM a purple heart barnstar; the purple heart of course being awarded to those injured in battle; what a nice fitting tribute to the battleground that is Volunteer Marek's talk page  it's still displayed there. Perhaps a Polish speaker can tell us what it means?Sandstein, you should start doing the right thing right about now!

"i agree with you for the most part ... but with one important caveat.  you said that id was a subset of creationism.  don't you think it's more fair to say that creationism is a subset of ID, since all creationists believe in intelligent design of necessity, but believers in ID need not believe in God?  Theistic creationism is one of the potential identities for the designer, but not the only one  and is therefore relevent.by analogy, punctuated equilibrium and gradualism are alternative descriptions of the broader ""theory of evolution""  but both are relevent in a discussion of the theory.  wouldn't you see that both theistic and non-theistic potential designers are relevent to ID?   21:19, 25 Nov 2004 (UTC)"	0|0|0|0|0|0
Hi there, I am a new user (about two months) and live a peripatetic life, migrating from Nepal to St Paul Island, Alaska with frequent stops in Othello, Washington, where I grew up ages ago (I'm 51). I have had several 'careers' but now work as quality control and health and safety person (seasonally) for a small fish processing plant on St Paul island to finance my travels. My WP editing is mostly typos and usage stuff (see slaying slews on my user page), adding links to deadend pages, and I have started participating in some AfD debates, although not many. I have created one new article, the short and rather minorly important Corfu slide.I've had one small run-in with another editor (see Re: my copyvio tag on User talk:Noroton)regarding my mistaken blanking of an article for copyvio. I apoligized to him although I'm not sure if the article had been cleared although the notice was removed. The primary reason I requested adoption was that I am looking for some direction on copyvio matters. I hit the random page button alot and also work on deadend pages and I seem to be seeing tons of stuff that violates copyright, obvious cut and paste jobs about companies or persons, usually with a link to the copyvio right at the end of the article! Looking at WP:CV I seem to get conflicting directions. The first box advising proposing speedy deletion and leaving the article intact, the second box (titled 'Article?') saying to revert if possible, if not then blank the page, etc.Then I see this, '...Some cases will be false alarms. For example, if the contributor was in fact the author of the text that is published elsewhere under different terms, that does not affect their right to post it here under the GFDL. Also, sometimes you will find text elsewhere on the Web that was copied from Wikipedia. In both of these cases, it is a good idea to make a note in the talk page to discourage such false alarms in the future...,' in WP:C which would seem to allow most of the things I have tagged and/or deleted!I have done different things at different times, deleted copyvio and left a stub if I think it notable, proposed speedy, blanked and listed (the 'Article?' option), and with one exception, my mistake which I apologized for, I haven't received any feedback + or -. I must admit that the laziness rather than the legality of it is what bothers me about this as in most cases the website and article creator are probably one and the same, but still...Here is some examples. New page, West Wisconsin Telcom is a copy from the 'about' page of, you guessed it, [Wisconsin Telcom]. The page was created in one edit by a user with no other edits and no user or talk page. Marriage Equality New York Inc, is copied from: hereAltoona community theatre which is copied from hereand hereWhat is the proper way of dealing with this? Propose speedy delete and leave page intact? No clean revert so blank and use copyvio|url=www.wwt.net/aboutus.php, and the rest of the stuff in the 'Article?' box? Leave it for someone else to deal with and mind my own business?Wikipedia can be a little daunting to newcomers as there seems to be much jargon, abbreviations and references to seemingly conflicting WP pages and policies. I have no problem being bold but also don't want to be a jerk. It would be great to have someone with experience to check with on occasion.OK, that's what I'm really wondering about right now. I have stopped doing anything about copyvio for now other than adding pages to my watch list until I get some direction on this.Thnx,	0|0|0|0|0|0

USS NAUTILUS SSN-571 Collision with USS ESSEX CVS-9, April 1967 I was a junior officer serving in ESSEX in 1967 as a CICWO. At the time of the collision I was soundly asleep in the junior officer bunkroom tucked under the flight deck in the forward section of the ship (We were standing Port and Starboard watches under Condition 1 AS, a modifified form of anti-submarine battle stations) when a loud noise was heard and a brief shudder passed through ESSEX, a 29k ton anti-submarine aircraft carrier. ESSEX went promptly to general quarters which is standard operating procedure for protecting a naval ship in the case of a collision of unknown proportions or a fire not under control as the crew immediately mans their battle ststions, including manning damage control parties, and sets Condition Zebra which secures all water-tight hatches throughout the ship.ESSEX, her task group comprised of several destroyer and destroyer escorts, and NAUTILUS were conducting exercises in the Virginia Capes Operations Area (VACAPESOPAREA. ESSEX was being replenished underway by a fleet oiler and both ships were being screened by the escorts. The wind was backing and the UNREP ships were altering ROMEO CORPEN (replenishment course) five degrees to port to put the relative wind 355 degree relative to their ship's head. NAUTILUS successfully penetrated the screen and was simulating torpedo attacks when she apparently miscalculated either her submerged depth and/or the course of the mainbody. NAUTILUS's conning tower struck ESSEX which draws 29 to 30 feet depending on how she is loaded, on the forward port quarter of her bow-mounted SONAR. NAUTILUS was believed to roll to starboard and to pass under ESSEX keel rerighting herself as she executed an emergency surfacing procedure in he vicinity of ESSEX elevator on her starboard side, some 500-600 feet from her bow. NAUTILUS appeared as though the forward leading corner of her sail area had been bitten cleanly off. Injuries were minor to two NAUTILOS crewman and to a Sonarman First Class in ESSEX. NAUTILUS did not suffer any apparent damage to her nuclear reactor or powerplant. No leaks of radioactive material were reported as testimony to her thorough construction. ESSEX's bow mounted sonar was badly dented/deformed but the ship's water-tight integrity was never breached, and she transited to the Boston Naval Shipyard for repairs and deployed in late May 1967 for an EASTLANT NATO Anti-submarine exercise (ASWEX).	0|0|0|0|0|0

" Symbolism of resignation date It should be noted that Joseph Ratzinger, ex-conscript in (Adolf) Hitler Youth, announced its resignation as Pope Benedict XVI on february 11th 2013, Benedict of Aniane and Adolf of Osnabrück feast dayCaholic online. February fest days http://www.catholic.org/saints/f_day/feb.php. Maybe, this shoud be added in hid biography.   WP:SYNTH   Close, but there's no conclusion. Not combining sources, just listing two. Just out of curiousity, NummerSechs, why should this be noted? Is there anything beyond it just being a sort of weird coincidence?  (talk) 02:22, April 4, 2013 (UTC)Please READ WP:SYNTH which says: Do not combine material from multiple sources to reach or imply a conclusion not explicitly stated by any of the sources. If one reliable source says A, and another reliable source says B, do not join A and B together to imply a conclusion C that is not mentioned by either of the sources. Emphasis is mine.   I get that. But what's the implication? He announced his resignation on February 11, and February 11 was the feast day of saints with loosely-related names, therefore...?  (talk) 06:59, April 4, 2013 (UTC)Since, I do not agree at all with InedibleHulk & Elizium23's comments, I put also this discussion on their talk page. Everything a Pope does, speaks, writes, acts, etc. is think well in advance on a very symbolic basis. Denying that, without arguments better than a lawyer point of view, means a complete ignorance about the essence of Pope's role in catholic world & over other Christian churches. BTW, I'm French, not Anglo-saxon, learned german at school, (J. Ratzinger is German) and I do believe that I have quite an authority to write that, since France is recognized Rome's first daughter.   we can just say that it happens to be the same day as those feasts and let the readers draw their own conclusions. otherwise it is WP:synth. I do know German quite well, I have taken 3 years of German classes, one year has been college-level.  Aunva6talk - contribs  It should be noted that February the 11th, Catholic Church also celebrates Notre Dame de Lourdes a.k.a Our Lady of Lourdes (south-west of France). Another (non related ?) coincidence  François-Bernard Michel who co-presides the Lourdes Medical BureauComité Médical International de Lourdes (in french) http://fr.lourdes-france.org/approfondir/guerisons-et-miracles/composition-comite-medical-international-lourdes, presides also the French National Academy of Medicine for the year 2013. He is also member of the Académie des Beaux-Arts, he presided twice, at Institut de France, chair XIII, created in 1998.   Very good.  Before rushing in with this sort of thing, people should know that ""superficial similarities spawn spurious statements"" and ""capricious coincidences cause careless conjectures"".

Controversies - Did he had conspired 9/11? I don't want to make Wikipedia offended (primarily the article), but I think it's strange that he had financed to implode the buildings on the World Trade Center. I don't think it would be relevant in the article by Wikipedia's standards or if I would receive a notification on disruption or something like that. Here I go. He is a Jewish person right? He wanted to implode the buildings for a war on Islam. Secondly, there was a television tower on top of the World Trade Center - does that seem weird to you people? That was all done for capitalism, propaganda, scare tactics, exploitation and viewers? No one talks about that. The television agencies wanted them to blame Islam for good measure, because of oil.  Oil, television agencies, government power, and lobbyist, in a government operated building. This man who had made up 9/11 is Jewish… It was all over religions… Jews versus Islams… Now governmental Jews are in power again only because of this incident …Just months before 9/11, there was over $3.4 trillion dollars financed to the city, and they agreed to this situation; however, he had gained profit from the victims, which he's at $7 billion (USD). He had knew about the asbestos before he had bought the World Trade Center in 1980's. Plus the towers of 2, 3, 4, and 7 - were over $10 billion (USD - with tax).  18:28 September 12 2013	0|0|0|0|0|0

Forty years ago, when the foregoing essay was written, the denial of competition had not yet effected the enormous concentration of wealth that now so gravely threatens social order. It was not yet too late to stem the current of accumulation by a reversal of the policy of monopoly. The Anarchistic remedy was still applicable.Today the way is not so clear. The four monopolies, unhindered, have made possible the modern development of the trust, and the trust is now a monster which I fear, even the freest banking, could it be instituted, would be unable to destroy.	0|0|0|0|0|0

Hindi Seems like you got confused with pro-Hindustani editors. Here is 65 year old statement: Article 351. Directive for development of the Hindi language- It shall be the duty of the Union to promote the spread of the Hindi language, to develop it so that it may serve as a medium of expression for all the elements of the composite culture of India and to secure its enrichment by assimilating without interfering with its genius, the forms, style and expressions used in Hindustani and in the other languages of India specified in the Eighth Schedule, and by drawing, wherever necessary or desirable, for its vocabulary, primarily on Sanskrit and secondarily on other languages.http://rajbhasha.nic.in/UI/pagecontent.aspx?pc=MzU=Hindi emerged as Apabhramsha, a degenerated form, in the 7th century A.D. By the 10th century A.D., it became stable. 'Braj, Awadhi, Khari Boli etc are the dialects of Hindi'. The present literary standard of Hindi is based on 'Khari Boli'. Hindi became the official language of India after 1947http://hindinideshalaya.nic.in/english/hindi_orgin/briefhistory.htmlWhere are other languages of India ? What about Braj bhasha, Khadi Boli, Awadhi, Chattisgariya  ? They can call Hindi as much as Urdu speaking people are calling Hindi as Hindustani. The Hindi I speak has more Punjabi & English words than Urdu. The list goes on.65 years are more than enough to change a language. We know that Hindi of 1960s is not same as Hindi of today. Even Indian English has emerged as major L2 speakers of English in last 65 years.	0|0|0|0|0|0

"Looks like, among other things, he was that, at least near the end of his life. HR vol. 15 no. 3 (May / June 1995), pg. 46: In a letter, Martin writes, ""Personally, I am about brimful (sic?) on 'gas chambers' and may stop reading about the subject. As I have mentioned, I classify them with unicorns; for centuries Europeans have believed tenaciously in the latter since at least the time of Aristotle, but in all that time never came up with one. Maybe there will be centuries of belief in 'gas chambers' with the same consequences. I am sure the 'hoax Establishment must stick by this fantasy, for to admit that it is all smoke would seriously undermine faith in anything else they allege. However, they did slink off from the fable of soap made from Jewish fat...""One letter of Martin's which is available online appeared in JHR vol. 12 no. 2 (Summer 1992), pg. 251). In a letter entitled ""Reflections on a Death,"" Martin writes about the Holocaust, ""...the Holocaustians have turned the whole thing into a new religion anyway. To me there is a close relation between a racket like this one and spiritualism, for example. Holocaust zealots trap their revisionist critics in much the same way that the spiritualists treated their scoffers during their heyday...The 'Hoaxers' do much the same thing: the more outrageous of the Holocaust atrocities they endlessly circulate don't have to be proven. Instead, it is up to those who deny they happened to prove they did not...One of these days I should try to get a foundation to underwrite a trip to central Africa. After returning I would announce that I had encountered a tribe of talking monkeys, and then challenge anyone who does not believe me to prove otherwise."" (See: http://www.ihr.org/jhr/v12/v12p245_Letters.html#Martin)(above from ). That, and spending 25 years hanging out with IHR puts at the very least a serious taint of holocaust denial on his fascinating resume. ∇∆∇∆ "	0|0|0|0|0|0

When you remove thing like this you PEOPLE IN QUOTE who claim you know us more than US. just come back to insert it.. What is the all purpose of wikipedia, to inform or to MISINFORM.. Change you view Rhobite.. If you are going to be objective be..You are not God, if been a moderator make you feel on top of the world, please it is not an achieve , the owner of wikipedia get paid, you are just a tool, been use and that can be dispost of any day.. from what i see, from your talk, if you have start your on .com company you would have made money for yourself. but you just spend your energy and time on building another man wealth. This is an Advice to you Rhobite. it is just an advice , you do not have to take.. time is a precious thing...

Tawrat is the same word as Torah. Neither the author nor the audience knew enough to draw a distinction between this, or the Injil, and the Tanakh and New Testament respectively.. Even today, a lot of Christians would make this same mistake, as many know the word Torah, but Tanakh is obscure. Here in the seventh century Hejaz, there's no indication of firsthand knowledge, when there is as in Bukhari or in the judgment of the Banu Qurayza it stands out for it, and is in each instance explicitly attributed to Hebrew speakers who knew the scriptures. No one spoke Greek either. I can't recall any direct quoes from either set of scriptures in the Qur'an, and there are several high profile errors. As for whether God would speak imprecisely or in error, I think that question outside the scope of an academic project.	0|0|0|0|0|0

"This article suffers from poor translation - whether that is someones idosyncracy, or a translation engine run amok.  Actually it is not too bad if it JUST a translation engine...Additionally, it reads rather like a self-aggrandizing press release.  Oh well.Biography and creativity [edit] Early years Viktoria Daynekos born on 12 May 1987 in village in the Kirov Taldy-Kurgan area. Her childhood was spent in the Yakut city Mirny (Yakutia). Since her childhood, she dreamed of becoming a variety singer, but her parents did not take her desire seriously. In school, Victoria (Vika) started to sing various Mirny (Yakutia) musical genres, mainly covering the hits of others. As she was in a small town, without any special educational institutions, Vika educated herself.  Vika seriously engaged the English language. [edit] Star Factory Alla Pugacheva is DOUBTLESS a link here... should be looked up and addedIn 2004 Victoria was the participant of the Channel One’s teleproject Star Factory Series 5 under the direction of Alla Pugacheva, which she won. Within the limits of the teleproject, Victoria sang two solo songs — «I will be better» and ""Leila"".  Vika also sang a duet with Alexander Marshal «Dreamed me». ((I Dreamed?!  Dreamed of me,?!)) The duet was so pleasant to the public, that it has been decided to make a joint clip — Victoria's first video. [edit] ""Post-factory"" life [edit] 2005—2006 After the termination of the teleproject, Victoria began serious work Igor Matvienko. The debut clip of singer for the song ""Leila"" was shot in 2005 in Thailand. New songs with which, Vika acted on the various platforms, new further clips have followed. In parallel with this development, Victoria's life was often discussed in press—in 2006, the singer dated the member of the group «Korni» Pavel Artemyev. Although the affair did not last long, it has left a trace — a clip plot on a song of Dayneko «I will simply leave from you at once» (""Я просто сразу от тебя уйду"") based on the idea of director Victor Priduvalov and a hit has been closely connected with the Korni’s clip «You want I will sing to you» (""Хочешь, я тебе спою"") [edit] 2007 In the beginning of 2007, Victoria wrote a soundtrack to the film «In expectation of a miracle» — «Film not about love».  A videoclip on this song was made in parallel with filming. She was nominated in the autumn of 2007 as «Best performer» in the MTV Russia Music Awards. ((Fragment, as a result of having conceded to the singer MakSim.)) Also she was the winner channel Fashion TV award «fashion-singer of 2007». In the beginning of the same year, Victoria took part in photos for April issue of magazine Playboy, which she has regretted. In 2007 she also participated in the project Glacial Age. In this project she was ""star"", being trained and supported by Alexei Yagudin — the first class figure skater. Victoria and Alexei reached the project ending, but did not reach prize-winning places. With Alexei, Vika wrote a song ""Needle"", of which there has been made a videoclip. There are rumours about a novel.  To date, theya re only rumours. Also in 2007 Victoria tried out in film. She appeared in a a small, bit part, in a teleserial «Happy Together», where Vika has played herself; She has also has voiced the main heroine Panti in an animation «Noev an ark» with the Russian version of a Gloria Gaynor’s song «I Will Survive». [edit] 2008— present On 6 March 2008 She released a debut album ""Needle"". The album became «the collection of hits of the singer» as it was the first album for 3 years of work. Now Victoria begins work on the second album. [edit] Releases [edit] Discography «Needle» (2008) [edit] Track-list 1.Needle (Иголка) (feat.

The menpower before was the so called Verpflegungsstärke, iam missing the english word but this means the strengh was every listed personnel in this units so auxillary units were included. i decided to takethis number becuse most articles use this number. but the russian number dropped by 900.000. this is explained easily too. glantz/dapi ( i dont know if glantzreally uses this number ) didnt count the entire steppe front ^^ i explain this ""trick"" with tanks:the tanks: we can see perfectly on the tanks. before dapis edit, the infbox showed 4.900 russian AFV but now only 3,155. i looked my sources and find1,607 tanks for the central  1,699 voronez that makes 3,306( this is glantz numbers plus some tanks), this number is already higher than glantz ""numbers"" but now it comes, he totally forgot the steppefrontwith 1,632 tanks, the same steppefront which used many of his armies to support the southern wing. to exclude the steppefront is nothing less than russian bias and vandalizm. during operaiton zitadelle the westernfront and the brijansk front started attacking the german units both fronts together fielded another 3,200 tanks lol . but thistroops are no included. i dit not include this troops too because i was aware that this will be reverted but to be honest all participating russian fronts fielded~8,000 tanks ^^( to compare please take zetterling who wrote a book about the numbers of kursk ) but glantz achieve a much lesser number with excluding entire fronts. alone rotmistrovs 5th Guards Tank Army fielded 800 tanks and attacked mansteins tropps^^.so the russian numbers are simply selective, if a front took part or dont doesnt madder... .but why are the german tanks so high now?while glantz is excluding entire russian fronts he brings a strange number for german tanks, when i check the sources i found 3,534 tanks ( zetterling/frankson wrote a book only about the numbers behind kursk, frieser and the german ministry for militarystudy support with primary data) for the eastern front. glantz brings 3,155 tanks . lol . i dont know were this numbers came from but this would mean that the 3 german armies had 90% of all tanks in this 3 armies ( one is only armygroup ).this is bullshit we have a list for all german units and tanks, glantz number is wrong. the joke is while he excludes the entire steppe front brijansk and westernfront he dont excludes allthe german reserves which werent used like the tankcorps around the 5th SS wiking this units werent used. but the used russian units are excluded . heavy bias.... . i can support my points withsources . i would suggest dapi does the same and we discuss the book of glantz. please tell me what glantz says why he excludes the other fronts.... . to avoid such bias i created notes so that everyreader can click and see immediate which army/front had how much tanks, that was good i think....dapi comments his changes with ""removing unreliable ed"" []he calls frieser ( and the Militärgeschichtliche Forschungsamt Deutschland and his 5 co-autors ) zetterling/frankson ( they made a book only about the numbers of kursk ) and koltunov unreliable evenkrivosheev becomes ""dubios"" for user dapi [].while he uses glantz who was punked by blatant propaganda[] and seems to fake numbers to support his factthat red army didnt need numerical superiority. a interesting example is that dapi uses glantz to cite 350 tank losses for prokhorovka ( the mythbattle) and the same book is used to cite 340 lossesfor the complete ""zitadellecampaign"" -) . here it must be noted that user dapi89 is a big fan of frieser, he is citing him always when talks about blitzkrieg and to revert edits on the blitzkrieg-page. so his opinions is not straight...other edits which elimanted every	0|0|0|0|0|0

I do think it's pretty important to include in the article why proponents of these ideas support them (beyond the self-interest of parents), as well as the scientific criticisms.

"I have tried many times to remove Prague Process from that subheading, and i presume it was you who kept putting it back there because nobody else seems interested in this article. I propose calling it ""Aftermath"" and deleting everything that the sources do not link as a direct consequence of the PD. ""Aftermath"" means ""Aftermath of the Prague Declaration"" not ""similar things that happened after the PD was declared"". To use an admittedly oversimplified analogy - if some MEPs made a declaration calling for the Sun to rise and fall each day, you could not say that daylight was part of the ""Aftermath"" of their declaration.And again, about the ""rejection"" - Can we use the wording ""kept under review, pending legal changes that are highly complicated and will probably never happen due to a lack of enthusiasm and a lack of perceived necessity?"" No, I think rejection is more accurate. so does the Guardian. It's not my POV, it's simply what the word ""rejected"" means in plain english. http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/dec/21/european-commission-communist-crimes-nazismThankyou for your answer on the fact that only two proposals have so far been taken up positively at european level.

2011-12 NextGen Series I didn't mean to undo all your hard work. However, the reason I removed it is WP:WEIGHT. An article should not give undue weight to any aspects of the subject but should strive to treat each aspect with a weight appropriate to its significance to the subject. For example, discussion of isolated events, criticisms, or news reports about a subject may be verifiable and neutral, but still be disproportionate to their overall significance to the article topic. This is a concern especially in relation to recent events that may be in the news. Note that undue weight can be given in several ways, including, but not limited to, depth of detail, quantity of text, prominence of placement, and juxtaposition of statements. I don't see why the final should have the line-ups when no other match does. This is the page for the entire tournament, not just the final.	0|0|0|0|0|0

"I hope it's clarified. The ideas were connected in my head, but I did not mean to imply that you want PHG banned solely or even predominantly because of incivility. I agree that PHG needs to better accept criticism and learn a thing or two about reliable sourcing (hence my emphasis on OWN and RELIABLE), but I have yet to see the evidence (which isn't to say it doesn't exist) that he ""pour[s] bad information and fringe theories into Wikipedia"". Also, to say that your main focus is not his incivility, while true, ignores the fact that it was brought up enough at ArbCom to generate a ""reprimand"" and it has been brought up since at various talk pages as he re-invigorates old issues. And another thing, you must realise that he personally targets you because he feels personally targeted? I have tried to advise PHG to leave this whole topic area well alone for a while (~a year) until heads have utterly cooled. This won't work, however, if you follow him around tagging his articles, like the France-Japan one. Whatever the merits or value of that (I'm unsure either way yet), it demonstrates the need for a better and broader solution than the current ArbCom one. Frankly, I like your sourcing amendment, I'd even consider lessening the length of the ban if PHG were willing to comply with your amendation for the good of the project, since I think sourcing is the major issue here.

I revised and expanded the article.     and Westbrook Pegler I noticed your reversion of 's edits to the Westbrook Pegler article.  He has also made questionable edits to the William S. Burroughs article in which it is clear that he finds Burroughs' political views, or rather the views he implies Burroughs held, to be objectionable.  It seems that Betempte cannot make edits without adding his opinion about the subject.  This is something that may need to be watched.  Cheers! -The '45  United States edit Following a discussion at talk, my recent collaborative edit with Dancing Philosopher and Golbez copyedits the third United States intro paragraph with the lead transition sentences, A ""second war of independence"" in the War of 1812 secured U.S. territorial claims against the British Empire and guaranteed Canadian integrity. The United States then embarked on a vigorous program of expansion across North America throughout the 19th century. ...  Could you give it a look-see relative to your background in the War of 1812?   looks ok to me. )    Strange edit Can you explain this edit? It seems to me to replace perfectly good punctuation with strange punctuation that makes nonsense of the sentence. Have I misunderstood? I don't understand the edit summary comment about ""reject[ing] the Wikipedia ethos"", but whatever you think of an editor, that does not justify reverting a perfectly constructive edit.   I have no problem with the commasbut the previous ""edit summary"" was obscene and disgusting and degrading to Wikipedia and could not be allowed to stand.  I agree that the edit summary was unhelpful (though ""obscene and disgusting and degrading"" seems somewhat of an overstatement). However, to revert a good edit because you don't like the accompanying edit summary makes no sense, and besides, the edit summary still does stand, as reverting the edit does not remove the edit summary.   the statement I consider obscene, disgusting and degrading was ""who wrote this originally? an illiterate american(did I just repeat myself), or a fucking 2 year old?)"". That bespeaks an editor who does not respect the Wikipedia ethosand a ""comma fanatic"" willing to make such outrageous statements over a trivial comma issue.   The comma in question does seem to have affected the meaning of the sentence—it is not the sort of ""take it or leave it"" comma which only a comma fanatic would insist on. We may therefore be dealing with some sort of all-purpose grammar fanatic, who threatens myriad rude improvements. Only time will tell.   OK, Rjensen, thanks for pointing that out. I had assumed that you were referring to the edit summary in the edit that you reverted in the edit I linked to.

" If most Protestants were not 'informers' that would probably be because they had no information to pass on. However I think Sarah unwittingly and superbly illustrates the reason why using the word 'informer' in this article is utterly inappropriate and far from neutral. She says ""common usage in Ireland [so] describes (then and now), local inhabitants who give information to the British."" But Ireland then and now also includes the Protestant north whose Protestant inhabitants see themselves as British and would no more think of not 'informing' than would an American who spotted an Al Quaeda operative setting up an ambush in Chicago. And they would not be pleased to have the epithet 'informer' thrown at them. Irish Protestants in the south then, or the north now would never use the word 'informer' in this context and their view should not be disregarded in Wikipedia. Sarah may assume they do not exist or are irrelevant but their continued existence is the reason she is editing this article in the first place. Neutrality requires another phrasing.   "	0|0|0|0|0|0

Hank Zipzer- Barfing in the Back SeatHank Zipzer is a fifth grader who consistently gets in trouble and has learning difficulties. In this book, Hank’s dad, Stanley Zipzer, raced into the room where the Zipzer family was sitting. Excited he exclaimed, “Road trip!” He was so happy that he knocked over the Raisin Bran Hank was eating. Fortunately, Cheerio, their dog, consumed the spilled cereal; the Zipzer family never needed to clean up anything since they got Cheerio. Hank asked if they had to come as well with Stan and Randi Zipzer, Hank’s parents. Emily, who always liked to answer people’s questions explained that they would never let them stay home with the TV remote and microwave dinners. The only reason dad wanted to go on a road trip was because there was a crossword puzzle tournament; Hank’s dad loved crossword puzzles and when he saw one, he never took his eyes of it. The only things Hank could say were wow, oh wow and wowee wow wow wow. Mum promises that they would go to a theme park, called Colossus Coaster Kingdom. They were also allowed to bring one special guest of their choice along with them. Emily chooses Katherine, her iguana, and Hank chooses Frankie Townsend. Ms Adolf gives Hank a homework packet which has nine-hundred pages and Hank cannot go on any of the rides until he finishes all of his homework. They are all allowed to choose a place to stop at. Dad picked a library. Emily and Katherine choose the science museum. Frankie Townsend picks a basketball court. Mum chooses a honey farm and Hank chooses the theme park. Dad looked at the library, Emily studied the museum, mum looked the farm and they went to a hotel where Hank loses his homework; Frankie had to give up twenty pounds and his trip to the court just to save Hank. Hank doesn’t finish his homework on time and cannot go on any of the rides; he had to watch his dad complete all his crossword puzzles. Mr Zipzer becomes one of the top five people who participated. Everyone didn’t complete the puzzle in the time that was given. First place was Martina Stone from Cheyenne, Wyoming. Second place was HANK’S DAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Since Hank didn’t complete the homework packet, he had no idea what words will come out of Ms Adolf’s mouth this time. Anyway, Hank didn’t care about not completing his homework because always getting detention was usual for him.	0|0|0|0|0|0

" lived in Denmark between 910-940 AD, and was the son of Gorm. Contrary to popular opinion, Bluetooth or ""Blåtand"" as it was in old Viking language had nothing to do with a blue tooth. It means dark complexion – he had very dark hair, which was unusual for Vikings. Not only did Harald not fit the classic image physically, he was a rather unusual Viking. That is, if your understanding was that the life of a Viking was all battles and pillage. The good King Harald brought Christianity to Scandinavia and also ""united"" Denmark and Norway. And while we are destroying long-held beliefs, Vikings did not have horns on their helmets! Much of Harald’s history was learnt from two runic stones erected to his memory in the town of Jelling in Denmark."	0|0|0|0|0|0
Gina Miller destroyed a 10 years long project in 10 minutes HiSince 1997 I was saving images and later when fotki became real, I uploaded all my images, saves to one domain. However because of 1 complain, they deleted all my work in a few seconds. Fotki told me it was because of a complain, but Gina emailed me that same week about that. I refused to agree with her and then she attacked my work on fotki. My work was freely available to hundreds of people, I considered the images property of the web, as here on wikipedia. I always think that information should be free, but now my work which took 10 years to accomplish, disapeared in a few minutes from the non thought action of Gina. Personally I feel it as very painful. I hope Gina will regret her action.	0|0|0|0|0|0

"I was rather intrigued by the addition made by 76.191.230.178, ""that on June 5th, the United States sent Israel ammunition and jet fighters"", taken from Quigley's ""The Case for Palestine"" (p. 162). Quigley's book can be viewed on both Google Books and Amazon, where this exact statement appears with a reference to page 216 in Donald Neff's ""Warriors For Jerusalem"" (1984). I troubled myself to the library and found the relevant paragraphs. In an episode titled ""June 5: Israel Attacks"", Neff says the following about president Johnson (top of page 216):""He also received a message from his friend Arthur Krim. A memorandum to the President that day read: ""Arthur Krim reports that many arms shipments are packed and ready to go to Israel, but are being held up. He thinks it would be most helpful if these could be released.""Under the message the President had scribbled: ""1,000 rounds of 105mm artillery shells cleared. 2,000 fuses - availability, Gas masks. New Requests: A-4 jet fighter-bombers Hawk antiaircraft missiles.""Before the day was out, Krim was informed that gas masks had already been dispatched to Israel and he left a message for Johnson expressing his appreciation.""That's it. The rest of the page deals with various people he met and communicated with, and has nothing to do with arms shipments of any kind. In short, Quigley's assertion that ""on June 5th, the United States sent Israel ammunition and jet fighters"" is unsupported by the evidence he provides. The only thing documented as sent are gas masks. There's no indication if and when any ammunition had even been dispatched and an Israeli request for jet fighters, possibly made on June 5, somehow becomes jet fighters sent to Israel. In light of this I am deleting the sentence from the article.   "	0|0|0|0|0|0

"Developing your user page - it is easyWikipedia is a megalopolis and like in any city, interactions are very important. I recommend that you develop your user page so that people who visit your page may know your interests and share in them. It could be a single line telling others of not only your name but what you like or a complex page with every single thing that interests you on it. This is a great way of building up work groups that facilitate the sharing of expert knowledge on articles, talks etc. Happy building!!!     talk Become a great editor through diligenceBeing a member of  the welcoming committee on Wikipedia I encourage you to help Wikipedia in any way you can to increase human knowledge. If you have credible information about a topic with verifiable references please feel free to add to that topic. If there is no article on that topic, why not start it, with time others will add to it and it may even make the featured articles list. By doing this, I have been able to make over 6000 page edits in both new articles, article improvement etc. Furthermore, I encourage you to aim to be a member of the  autoconfirmed users [] group as this will greatly improve your Wikipedia experience. You can do this by making at least 10 credible edits on Wikipedia and remaining on Wikipedia for four (4) days. Check out this page for tips.    talk Adding media to  articlesMedia files, be it images, drawings or sound files are an integral part of Wikipedia's articles. They apart from enriching articles, make them more credible too. You can add media files to both your new articles as well as once you are editing. To do so you can search for it on wikipedia:commons or you can either upload the image if you have it using this file uploader or [commons uploader]. Please be informed that you must provide accurate information about the file being uploaded since they are reviewed and if if is found that the license given to the file is false, it will promptly be deleted.     talk Spotting bad edits and vandalismAs you age on Wikipedia, one thing you will come across and probably address will the issue of bad edits or vandalism.

Therefore, we use the nationality held at the time the subject became notable in the lead sentence, and mention any addition nationalities in separate sentences.

"It does not matter if they disclaim it's truthfulness. What matters is if they adhere to its teachings. There are some within the Church, sadly, who do not believe the Book of Mormon to be true - rather they believe it is inspired, non-historical scripture, or that it contains good teachings. Some of these would say the Book of Mormon is the word of God, others may not. However, they adhere to its teachings and would thus be classified as adherents to Mormonism. I agree that CoC are moving farther and farther away from ""Mormonism,"" but until they completely turn away from the history, culture and teachings they are still a part of Mormonism. Please note I didn't say they were Mormons, but rather adherents to Mormonism. The term Mormon in its connotation is narrow enough now to refer to members of the LDS Church and its 20th century offshoots, not most of the pre-1900 offshoots. It is NPOV to say they adhere to Mormonism. But not to say they are Mormons.

About the only statement in the above that I whole-heartedly agree with is that there are many other articles on Wikipedia about contemporary artists that are just as biased, if not more so, than Catman Cohen.  Also, the fact that he is anonymous is not at all the basis of my concern about the article.

"New sub-catagoryI wanted to add something about the “Persian or Farsi” controversy, but first wanted to consult everyone on this. Let’s talk about both, the pros and the cons, and keep it impartial. There are valuable issues raised by renowned Persian scholars. I quote from an article on the same subject:→ Identity Aspect: The word Persian in the mind of an English speaker, consciously or not, recalls many other historical and cultural legacies about Iran. Persian is closely associated with Persian poetry, Persian carpets/rugs, Persian cats, Persian poetry, Persian pistachios, and so on. When you refer to this language as Persian, the audience may associate it with one or more of these relevant ideas. On the contrary, the word Farsi not only voids these historical and cultural associations, but it also adds to the recent portrayal of Iran as a strange and distant society.→ Calling Persian as Farsi, is as incorrect as calling the Persian Gulf as the Farsi Gulf. Moreover, the name Farsi is obscure and under the best conditions refers only to certain dialects such as the Persian of Iran as opposed to Tajiki, the Persian of Tajikistan or Dari, the Persian of Afghanistan, or even one may say Isfahani, the Persian of Isfahan. → The use of word Farsi in English strikes a discordant tone to the native speaker. Imagine someone speaking in English about their recent trip to Paris saying, ""I went to Paris and there I spoke Francais."" (Instead of saying French). To use the word Farsi has the same impact and may sound not only pretentious at times but also destructive of English syntax.We should therefore avoid the use of the word Farsi instead of Persian because it not only violates historical fact but also some of the regularities of the language in which we speak. I believe that Persian is the true and proper name of this language in foreign tongues and international communities and changing it does not benefit the representation of Iranian culture."	0|0|0|0|0|0

If you're talking about the standard of joining gangs to overpower the bias of other gangs, I do not agree to that standard.  The standard I follow is simply to work with other editors to make each article a little better than we found it.  When a gang subverts that process by purposefully making articles worse as punishment or to serve a personal agenda, I tell them how I feel to their face.  Doing so is highly relevant to the article it affects and belongs in the discussion of that article.I understand the concept of harmonious editing, and I agree with it as a priority second only to making sure that relevant information is not subverted.  Information is not an enemy of an honorable person, but we see influential people here at Wikipedia who do little more than strip pertinent data from articles or delete entire pages of unique and beneficial knowledge.  These people play little games of waffling back and forth between demands for sources and, when they get sources, questions of relevance. (See Talk:State_terrorism for example.)  When their opponent suggests that they are being less than honest in doing so, these people block them for making personal comments.  It's all within the rules of a system where there is no accountability for power, but it is in direct conflict to our humanity and what we know to be right.  I am in the position of having a strict set of personal morals that I have never had to compromise.  I feel that I have a lot to offer Wikipedia, but I'm certainly not going to defile the principles I've honored my entire life to be an editor here.  When I see corruption, I am going to speak up.  What you choose to do, is up to you.	0|0|0|0|0|0

"Er let me see:Prose vs lists: Perhaps Prose is better than just plain lists (although some people seem to like and want lists, there are loads of ""list of...."" articles, which show the demand for it).  The nature of this particular article does tend towards bullet points: people usually want to make several points about the same subject, list several authors etc, and this is difficult to do coherently using prose.  The idea of bullet points was invented to overcome this very problem, and is becoming more common in modern prose.  (the only disadvantage is that it is worse if you read it aloud).  I have tried to plain lists, so for example I added a couple of lines (usually taken from their own Wikipedia pages) for some of the critics or responders whose only appeared as names.The problem with reliable sources. I am only copying in the pre-existing references.  But the real problem is that there is no definition of reliable, and being reliable is not quite the same as important.  If Gerry Falwell or Osama Bin Laden make a statement about Islam those statements becomes important because of wha made it, not necessarily because it has any acedemic validity.Balance of critiques and responses. Again I have only restructured what was there. The restructuring may make any lack of balance more obvious, and show where further work needs to be done.Section on Islam and War. Sperry's section on Islam and War was in before the restructure, I didn't notice the fight about it. I'm going to stand back from this one. If anyone else wants to restart this debate, please do so.

"==  Inclusion of school type, gender, and religious information for HNMCS ==There have been repeated deletions by Mikeycanuck (aka 99.254.17.230) which remove pertinent information about Holy Name of Mary College School (HNMCS) from this article. The two schools are brother and sister schools, and as per the History section in the HNMCS article, ""The Felician Sisters and St. Michael's College School co-founded the independent Holy Name of Mary College School"". As such, it is appropriate to contain some basic information about HNMCS in this article and in the same way, to include some basic information about SMCS in the Holy Name of Mary College School article. The inclusion of the school type (independent), gender (all-girls), and religious information (Catholic) of Holy Name of Mary College School in this article, is meant to illustrate the parallels to the school type (private), gender (all-boys), and religious information (Catholic) of St. Michael's College School.174.89.27.124  I don't agree that it is relevant information to give these details about Holy Name on the SMCS wiki. People reading the SMCS page quickly learn that Holy Name of Mary is the official sister school, and that it must be an all-girls school. That Holy Name is Catholic or private is also irrelavant in the SMCS article. If a reader interested in information on Holy Name wants to learn about it, he/she can go to the Holy Name wiki. I believe it should be removed as not necessary in an article about SMCS (and the same for St. Mike's info on the HNMCS wiki).  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 99.254.17.230   The point of including this basic information is to show how Holy Name of Mary College School and St. Michael's College School are connected by virtue of their school type, single-gender, and religious affiliation. The inclusion of this basic information is included to illustrate the parallels between the two schools.  These parallels are part of the reason they are brother and sister schools, and therefore this information is relevant and should be included in the article. 174.89.27.124  They are two separate institutions. If you want to write a paragraph describing the schools' connections, that can be done in sub-article within the main article. Readers can go to the other school's wiki for more detailed information and don't need to see it in the introduction, where it appears as self-serving PR. See Basic Navigation in Wikipedia  ""Wikipedia articles are all linked, or cross-referenced. When highlighted text like this is seen, it means there is a link to some relevant article or Wikipedia page with further in-depth information elsewhere. Holding the mouse over the link will often show to where the link will lead. The reader is always one click away from more information on any point that has a link attached.""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:About  So if understand correctly, the inclusion of a section on each wiki describing the links between the schools is an acceptable compromise in your view? 174.89.27.124  I only ask Mikeycanuck for clarification because it goes against his reasoning for removing the very basic information previously included in the introduction that drew the parallels between the two schools. In removing that content, Mikeycanuck commented (see View History), ""Removed superfluous information on Holy Name. Should be in HNM's wiki.""  So Mikeycanuck, you are adverse to very basic information included in the introduction, but you would welcome an entire paragraph within the article?  I want to ensure we have reached agreement before I go ahead and add that paragraph. 174.89.27.124  The detailed information does not belong in the introduction, which should always be concise and relevant. In a later section, a description of the school's links is acceptable, if it is relevant. If SMCS chose Holy Name as its ""sister school"" for certain reasons, and they are verifiable, I would not object. I am never opposed to compromise and reasonable discussion and discourse.

The other ironies of mentioning the 1958 Convention include the fact that Argentina never actually ratified that convention and that even if they had, geographic proximity was not, in and of itself, considered by that convention to be grounds to claim sovereignty over an inhabited territory controlled by another state.  Otherwise Japan would be part of Russia and Malta would be part of Italy and Sri Lanka would be part of India and so on through literally dozens of examples.  It's such a bad argument legally that I was concerned when it went in that including it might appear to discredit the Argentine position.  But if it is an argument made by Argentina and her supporters then it belongs.As a general rule, you can accept or refuse a proposal, but you may also make a counterproposal to improve the article.  It's not a flat yes or no, otherwise things would never improve.  For my part, I gave my position on the map above:I oppose any attempt to map the countries that support one side or other, as this is very difficult to get a clear position on.  But this is not such a map.I am indifferent to this map of the EU and its ORs and OCTs.  I have no problem with its going in, and I have no problem with its being left out. '''' talk	0|0|0|0|0|0

" From Loomis I guess I just missed your question. I rarely if ever ignore the challenge of an intelligent question. In fact, I'm sure you've noticed in my posts that I tend to repeat my philosophy over and over (perhaps too much!). I strongly believe in what's called the Socratic Method. By that I mean that I believe that the best way at arriving at (something at least close to) the truth is by asking questions, rather than stating opinions. Unless a question is completely insulting or moronic, I consider it a challenge to answer it. If I can't answer it properly, I force myself to rethink the matter.Your question was a good one, and it may take a bit of research on my part because, while I do believe I have a good deal of knowledge on the subject, you've touched on a couple of details I wasn't completely familiar with. Maybe I was just being lazy by overlooking your question. Or maybe it was because I just felt the rest of you guys have had enough of my opinionated and controversial posts, that I thought I should just leave it alone, and give you guys a break.In any case, I'll definitely give it some good thought and I promise to get back to you, ok! (Don't worry, don't feel like you're giving me ""extra work"". I'm actually flattered that you'd be interested in my response! I'll be more than glad to develop an answer, especially knowing that someone is actually interested in it!)I just have a few questions for you. I'm just curious about a few things. For one, I'm very curious about the name ""Evilbu"". Does it mean something in Flemish? (Is the ""Flemish language"" really any different from Dutch? I speak French and when I visited Belgium, their French was completely comprehensible, with the exception of a few odd words like ""septant"" rather than ""soixant-dix"" for ""seventy"", etc). Also, you said something about you ""being too young"". You don't have to answer any of these questions, I respect privacy. But if you don't mind, how old are you? Finally, you say you're ""not a Zionist"". That can mean one of two different things. One is that you're simply not a Zionist the same way as I'm simply not a Belgian. I've got nothing against Belgians, I'm just not Belgian. Similarly, you could have just been saying that you're simply not a Zionist. You've got nothing against Zionism, you just simply aren't one. Of course it could also mean something very different. It could mean that you're against Zionism.But that's ok too. I'm sure you know this, but the Jewish religion is a non-proselytizing religion. What that means is that we don't go around knocking on people's doors trying to convince them to become Jewish. In fact, we don't even find it necessary to explain or rationalize our faith to others. What we believe is what we believe, and what you believe is what you believe. No need to ""sell"" our religion to anyone else.The reason why I'm bringing this up is because unlike Judaism, Zionism, to a certain extent, has to be explained, clarified and rationalized to others. So what I'm saying is that while I won't even bother explaining Judaism (unless of course you're curious, and even then, it would be in a totally ""interfaith"" manner, respecting whatever you are and not trying to change it,) I believe it's my duty as a Zionist and as a Jew to help you to understand why we, as Jews, believe so dearly, that it is so incredibly important that we have a homeland, a safe haven.

"""May get blocked"" why?I'm at this point more than confused and disturbed that I am repeatedly threatened with being blocked for the crime of reporting the incessant racist rants and anti-Semitic personal attacks of another editor. I am equally confused and disturbed at accusations of ""soapboxing"" ""forum shopping"" and the are leveled at me, especially since my valid (and subsequently confirmed) complaint about anti-Semitic ranting was met with a response of ""Shut the hell up"" by a sorta maybe admin who shut the case. and I am as well confused and disturbed by the insinuations that I am somehow stampeding on this rabid anti-Semite's ""free speech"" by filing this complaint. The first, bold faced instruction on WP:TALK is that talk pages should not be used by editors as platforms for their personal views. Does this somehow not apply if those personal views are anti-Semitic, Jew bashing racist personal attacks? Is that an exception to WP:TALK?

"W, the number of editors helping you here is not at issue; neither is (by me at least) the verifiability of the statements and quotes the make up the section.  The balance of the section is what makes it ""unfair""; giving so much voice to Dreger's colleague who has made herself a principal in the disputes by campaigning with Bailey on radio and such about this is just too far out of line.  You chose to focus on Dreger's claim that the dispute has a significantly notable ""academic freedom"" component.  Yet you've resisted mentioning that the commentaries pretty much all disagree with her on many points, including some on this specific one.  I think a good step would be to add a quote from one that disagrees with her on this specific issue.  I've put one such quote on User talk:DarlieB in my discussion with her about that.  I don't know if that's enough to address her concerns; let's wait and see what she had to say."	0|0|0|0|0|0

"Here is part of the 1957 paper, ""The FORTRAN Automatic Coding System"" by Backus, et al., this snippet on the FREQUENCY statment and its use in a compile-time Monte Carlo simulation of the run-time to optimise the code generated. Quoting ...The fundamental unit of program is the basic block; a basic block is a stretch of program which has a single entry point and a single exit point. The purpose of section 4 is to prepare for section 5 a table of predecessors (PRED table) which enumerates the basic blocks and lists for every basic block each of the basic blocks which can be its immediate predecessor in flow, together with the absolute frequency of each such basic block link. This table is obtained by an actual ""execution"" of the program in Monte-Carlo fashion, in which the outcome of conditional transfers arising out of IF-type statements and computed GO TO'S is determined by a random number generator suitably weighted according to whatever FREQUENCY statements have been provided.Bests. - (Bob)   "	0|0|0|0|0|0

Zero is a valid code point, and the UTF-8 encoding of it is a NUL (`\0`) byte. An 0xC0, 0x80 sequence in a UTF-8 is an invalid overlong encoding. In fact, the overlong encoding of NUL is used as an example of a security issue from an incorrect UTF-8 implementation in the RFC.	0|0|0|0|0|0

" English encyclopedia or Encyclopedia for the english? I found absolutely stunning your remark in Talk:Harghita: ""no gain for the english reader to know the hungarian name of a city in Romania that hasn't got even a stub article about it"". You may check my comments on that talk page. And a friendly advice: please try to be more positive with this encyclopedia. Do good to others so that they can do good to you. Try to do things as if watching your actions from the outside; foresee how much controversy your actions would generate. Imagine, say, you looking at an article from a place in South America - you find that the article is a complete mess, because its authors wasted their energy (and time!) in such small fights over spanish or portuguese names issues.  28 June 2005 21:08 (UTC)"	0|0|0|0|0|0
I committed no vandalism, the previous sentence referred to josie and the pussy cats and the sentence following referred to dressing in ears and tails.  It seemed only natural to alter the sentence, which did no damage to the article, to turn it into a josie and the pussycats reference.	0|0|0|0|0|0

"==Dominican Americans==Please stop vandalizing the list of Dominican Americans with names of individuals that have no Dominican ancestry and/or who have never lived in the USA. John Lithgow is NOT Dominican. His father is a US Citizen born in Dominican Republic. Due to laws that prohibited dual citizenship in the past his father did not have Dominican citizenship, nor does have ancestry. His father can be added to the list with the mention that he was ""born in the DR"" however John does not qualify for inclusion.  Furthermore, Johnny Ventura and Juan Luis Guerra have never lived in the USA. Therefore they do not qualify as Dominican-Americans because they were not born in the USA nor emigrated. Please refrain from adding these names as it can be labeled as vandalism and will be reported to an administrator. Thank you for your understanding. "	0|0|0|0|0|0

There is simply no way you can start off with 0.999... and end up with 1 using transitivity of equality. Why? Because 0.999... is not equal to 1. It is less than 1.	0|0|0|0|0|0

>I often use NJ as an example in my arguements on this issue.  The ony difference with NJ is that Philly is right next to NJ as opposed to Boston not being any where near CT.

Sorry if the word 'nonsense' was offensive to you. Anyway, I'm not intending to write anything in the article(wow they would jump on me for vandalism), I'm merely requesting that it be more encyclopedic so one can use it for school as a reference. I have been to the selective breeding page but it's almost a stub. It points to 'animal breeding' which is a short messy article that gives you no info.

Before you start throwing accusations and warnings at me, lets review the edit itself-making ad hominem attacks isn't going to strengthen your argument, it will merely make it look like you are abusing your power as an admin. Now, the edit itself is relevant-this is probably the single most talked about event int he news as of late. His absence is notable, since he is the only living ex-president who did not attend. That's certainly more notable than his dedicating an aircracft carrier. I intend to revert this edit, in hopes of attracting the attention of an admin that is willing to look at the issue itself, and not throw accusations around quite so liberally. Perhaps, if you achieve a level of civility where you can do this, we can have a rational discussion on the topic and resolve the matter peacefully.	0|0|0|0|0|0

"Juelz Santanas AgeIn 2002, Juelz Santana was 18 years old, then came February 18th, which makes Juelz turn 19 making songs with The Diplomats.

He really is, how could he be older then Lloyd Banks? And how could he be 22 when his birthday passed? The homie neff is 23 years old. 1983 - 2006 (Juelz death, god forbid if your thinking about that) equals 23. Go to your caculator and stop changing his year of birth. My god."	0|0|0|0|0|0

"Re-considering 1st paragraph edit?I don't understand the reasons for 's recent edit of this article  not that I'm sure that the data are necessarily ""wrong.""  Rather, I'm persuaded that the strategy of introducing academic honors in the first paragraph is an unhelpful approach to this specific subject.  I note that articles about other sitting Justices have been similarly ""enhanced;"" and I also believe those changes are no improvement.  In support of my view that this edit should be reverted, I would invite anyone to re-visit articles written about the following pairs of jurists. A1. Benjamin Cardozo A2. Learned Hand B1. John Marshall Harlan B2. John Marshall Harlan IIThe question becomes: Would the current version of the Wikipedia article about any one of them  or either pair  be improved by academic credentials in the introductory paragraph?  I think not.Perhaps it helps to repeat a wry argument Kathleen Sullivan of Stanford Law makes when she suggests that some on the Harvard Law faculty wonder how Antonin Scalia avoided learning what others have managed to grasp about the processes of judging?  I would hope this anecdote gently illustrates the point. Less humorous, but an even stronger argument is the one Clarence Thomas makes when he mentions wanting to return his law degree to Yale.At a minimum, I'm questioning this edit?  It deserves to be reconsidered.   "	0|0|0|0|0|0

I was able to post the above list so quickly because I already had it in a text file in my hard drive  I've been meaning to get around to updating the sound list for some time now. As far as generating interest  I've spent four years trying to drum up more interest in freely licensed full length classical music. Unfortunately, my attempts failed - I'm still effectively the only one who does it. The classical music wikiproject was not interested, (Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Classical_music/Archive_5#Need_help.21Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Music/Archive_3#I_could_use_some_helpWikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Music/Archive_2#Raulbot.2C_and_the_music_list) So I really had given up trying to interest others.

"Not at all, you are making a straw man argument here. I never claimed O'Donohue had that position, rather that practitioners and researchers in the field ignored the DSM position, which is exactly what the quote says and also something O'Donohue agrees with. Again, I was combating the notion that it was a ""absurd part"" to claim that pedophilia is a sexual orientation. Since many researchers hold this position, it would be unfair to call it absurd. The disorder part is divided in the field, some argue that it is not a disorder at all, some do. At the end of the day, it is a value judgment (as Cantor pointed out earlier in the thread), not a scientific judgement. If we choose to make this value judgment in the article, it should be stated clearly and not pretend to have a scientific basis.   "	0|0|0|0|0|0

(Their definition of Southeast Asia includes southern China).  Then hypothesizes that ""the dispersals of Neolithic farmers from Southeast Asia also brought haplogroup O lineages to Korea and eventually to Japan."" In the concluding paragraph, it states ""we propose that the Yayoi Y chromosomes descend from prehistoric farmers that had their origins in southeastern Asia, perhaps going back to the origin of agriculture in this region.""

Notability of Rurika KasugaA tag has been placed on Rurika Kasuga, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article seems to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable, that is, why an article about that subject should be included in Wikipedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert notability may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, and if you can indicate why the subject of this article is notable, you may contest the tagging. To do this, add  on the top of the page (below the existing db tag) and leave a note on the article's talk page explaining your position. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm its subject's notability under the guidelines.For guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria for biographies, for web sites, for bands, or for companies.

I don't believe the Lisak criticism present there conforms with the NPV rule.  Lisak doesn't have a neutral point of view to begin with.  If an offer to polygraph or even concerned review of polygraph results shocks a complainant into thinking her lies have been uncovered, the recantation is still perfectly valid.  If you know you are telling the truth, you will argue with machine or investigator.  Also part of Kanin's research was a followup of the recanted story where possible to verify if any were false recantations.  In all followups the recanted version of events matched what the accused said happened.Arguing that Lisak is a respected PHD is baseless if Kanin is a respected PHD.  I agree that my edit wasn't as neutral as possible though, so apologize for that.  Still something must be done here.	0|0|0|0|0|0

"::::Jmabel; in regards to predominant scholary consensus who is it that allegedly claims ""despite ""Third Way"" rhetoric, fascism in power functioned rather consistently as a right-wing force""? As far as I'm aware (owning numerous books on the subject) that is not the scholary consensus at all. The consensus, developed by respected scholars of fascism who write in a manner which is not bias to any interest group such as Roger Griffin, Hamish McDonald, Roger Eatwell and Zeev Sternhell all recongise fascism as a ""Third Way"" as the references show.The only dissenters I'm aware of who seem to think fascism has absoutely no leftist connections and is merely a radical right system are street level socialists who want to put as much distance between the movements as possible. This of course does not come from educated people in a position to write books. For example, even the foremost scholary expert on Fascism, and a former member of both the Communist Party and then Socialist Party of Italy, Renzo De Felice doesn't try to ""cover up"" its socialistic origins and third way status.

The full quote is""If the mass of the tether alone started to exceed 200 times the mass of the payload,then that was an indication the particular scenario being considered was not engineeringlyfeasible using presently available materials, although the application might become feasible inthe near future as better materials become available with higher tensile strengths at higheroperational temperatures.""It then goes on to say""As we shall see, presently available commercial materials will suffice to make the HASTOLtethers needed. The primary message we want to leave with the Reader is:“We don't need magic materials like ‘Buckminster-Fuller-carbon-nanotubes’ to makethe space tether facility for a HASTOL system. Existing materials will do.”""So it would appear that you misread your reference.  The tether mass of 200 times mass of the payload mass is the upper limit to the problem.  Systems where the tether mass is less than 200 times the payload mass can be built with ""presently available commercial materials.""To further reinforce this the Conclusion to the report states""The fundamental conclusion of the Phase I HASTOL study effort is that the concept istechnically feasible.

" Ambiguous ? So Mabuska Irish can mean more than one thing ? I will qoute you on that .Thanks .  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 109.77.58.139   Of course it can. The word ""Irish"" wasn't invented on the establishment of the Irish Free State. Talk Quote me all you want, it depends on the context of the term when its being used as to whether its applicable or not. Note how i said citizenship and ethnicity - i never mentioned nationality which is the real key meaning. The nationality meaning of the term is the predominantly used form on Wikipedia. In nationality terms it refers to the Republic of Ireland. But you already know that i'm sure.  (talk) ""In nationality terms it refers to the Republic of Ireland"" no such country . so nationality terms it refers to Ireland .  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 109.76.191.188   Oh wow, Ireland as in Ireland the state (whose official description is the Republic of Ireland).

"Is it scientific to attribute an event A, to cause B, where cause B was deliberate designed, with some sort of intelligent intent? Don't answer the questions beyond thatWell, the problem with not answering beyond that is that your example is completely rigged. There are several major fundamental problems here.  First, you completely fail to mention the fact that the intelligence behind ID is quite literally not of this earth. Natural science might look at a honeycomb, see it is built by bees, and then find an odd looking fossilized honeycomb, and theorize that it was made by odd looking bees. That is fundamentally different than saying it was made by something not of this earth. ID has at its core the notion that something OUTSIDE the system we can observe is at cause here. This is not science in any sense of the word, it is mythology. When Paul Bunyan was having a wrestling match with babe his blue ox, they kicked up so much dirt they created the great lakes. No evidence of paul and his ox remain. i mean, really.  Second, natural science takes an approach to knowledge that nothing is known scientific law unless it is irrefutable. Theories must have heavy supporting empirical data to back it up. ID turns this on its head and does an end run around knowledge and plays games with ""probabilities"". If no one can say how flagella on bacteria could have formed naturally, how in the hell can ID proponents come up with any sort of mathematically accurate PROBABILITY of flagella naturally forming on bacteria? If you don't understand it, you can't do statistics on it. ID jumps right over that hurdle and takes anything that doesn't have a complete, detailed, natural explanation and jams in their own statistics that say ""well, it's so improbable for this to happen, that someone MUST have designed it"". This is such a perversion of science. You can assign probabilities to something you don't understand. ID is just making up their numbers.  Finally, your example has A->B, where B was deliberate design. that's all well and good for a rigged example, except that with respect to life on earth, ""B"" is unknown. Your A->B example might qualify as forensic science, if ""A"" were a dead body and ""B"" were a bullet in the heart. You see a bunch of dead bodies with bullets through the heart, the next time you see a body with a bullet through the  heart, you can probably figure that's what killed him. You don't have that with life on earth. You have ONE scenario, ""A"", and you have no other cases to observe or test. So, in that sense, A->B is not scientific if you've never actually observed ""B"". (btw, B is teh intelligent designer, which has NEVER been observed). So, in that sense, no, it isn't science.

I tend to think that when the list is longer than the rest of the article, there's a problem.  Either the history and characteristics should be expanded, of the list should be culled.  I personally like the consensus that was reached in the Tripel article between  and others...myself included.  We decided that the country of origin should be highlighted with the most examples.  There we did Trappist, Abbey, and Foreign.  Foreign includes all non-Belgium examples.  This way the article is an article in an encyclopedia, not a list.  People can find lists anywhere, and the article should reference this.  Also, the style statistics are bad.  When you say style statistics, it sounds like a prescription, not a description.  An encyclopedia should follow the latter, and if the former is used, a citation should follow...And you'll not find a valid one for this style in it's country of origin.	0|0|0|0|0|0

Paleontologists agree that organic remains must be buried quickly so they can be preserved long enough to be come fossilized.  However, the term fossilized is not a very precise term.  There are several factors and metamorphic mineral processes which occur to organic remains that result in what is typically called a fossil.  One major factor concerns what kind of organisms are to be fossilized  vertebrate, invertebrates, radiolarians, sponges, plants, pollen, foot prints, etc.  And multiple processes may include permineralization, recrystalization, carbonization, replacement, dissolving, diagenesis, etc.  Talking about fossilization is a complex issue, however quick burial is not questioned.The major question is, how long does it take for these processes to work on organic reamins in the environment they are found in?  Experimental taphonomy has resulted in an assortment of remains becoming fossilized by various processes in the lab, which of course implies that given the right conditions, vast ages are not an issue.  The metamorphic processes are ongoing until an equilibrium is met between the chemical enviroument of the burial site and the minerals of the organic remains.  Flood catastrophic geologists do not expect that organic remains buried during the flood were completely fossilized within the one year period of the flood, but rather that there has been some 4000 years for the processes to have been working.  Much more work needs to be done on the taphonomy of organic remains.  Yet, how one interprets even those results will depend upon which world view you choose to believe with.	0|0|0|0|0|0

The outside world knows little about these elusive characters, and the honour of the Witzeman. For those who have ever been a Witzeman, it has been said to have been a great honour, although the qualities needed for the job have never been disclosed. A person may not now they were a Witzeman for many years, until they are called by former Witzemans via dreams. Associates of the Witzeman are known to be a certain Babe Cool or the much lesser known Witzewoman.The Present Witzeman is an 11-year-old boy namely Benjamin Woods, who is said to have become a Witzeman after he felt this 'awesome radiance in his top-right bumcheek'. He has not told a great number of people his testimony, but has promised to do so in years to come.                           HistoryThe present world has only come enlightned with the knowledge of the Witzeman in present years, because former Witzemen have not been so public about the honour, to abide with the formality and conservativism in their time. The term 'Witzeman' is a compound word of the adjective Witze and 'man', witze being an 11th century term for 'a person of extreme humour and radiant intelligence'. Unfortuneatly, Witze is also sometimes associated with bad wind, for unspeakable reasons.                       Proper HistoryAs early as the 14th century, Witzemen were considered outcasts, and young children were encouraged to poke them with sticks. This led to the 1st Witzeman Rebellion of 1555 when the current Witzeman and his followers attempted a coup to take over the local Council chess team. This rebellion further disgraced the Witzeman, as he and his followers were embarassingly pronounced 'gaga' at a Government meeting that year. The period from here to the early 1900s was a dark time in the Witzemans history. However good times were to come for the Witzeman. Many normal people took part in mass demonstrations and protests for the Witzeman in the 1980s, building up to a great moment in the history...the Great Rebellion of 1988. This was when several Witzeman sprinted round the Visitors Gallery of the House of Commons, wearing clown masks, but otherwise completely naked. This was thought to be an act of circambulation. However many people who witnessed this shocking behaviour, were 'mentally, spiritually, and emotionallly scarred for life'. This group of people included many young children who were forced to go to asylums in a state of mental instability, suffering from trauma. It was at this time that the Government finally took positive action for the Witzeman. In 1990, a bill of rights for the Witzeman was signed, stating all Witzemen were allowed to do as they pleased. Although this was a formal agreement, many journalists viewed it as a letter of submission from the Government to the Witzeman, as the behaviour of the Witzeman and his followers became more and more twisted.	0|0|0|0|0|0

06, 29 December 2007 (UTC)Yep. LOL, the [[Reformist Party (Serbia)|Reformist Party] is having another go (the 20th very last on the parliamentary election, winning less votes than notable to actually be mentioned). ) By the way, here's something very little people have figured out - the new Constitution of Serbia has been brought to enable Kosovo' secession. The 1990 Constitution barred that as a possibility, and after the Kumanovo Military-Technical Agreement was signed between NATO and FRY the SRS broke its coalition with SPS and the government collapsed, causing new elections - because that was unconstitutional, as an act of highest treason, enough to be tried from maximum sentence (which the Radicals demanded from then to his death, to have a trial in Serbia, and to be tried for treason among other reasons). This constitution releases the authorities from that weight, and they won't have to go to prison if they recognize any form of further loss of sovereignty in Kosovo. ;)   15	0|0|0|0|0|0

You also failed to provide diffs in your message to me, in regards to which words you're claiming are offesive, perhaps WP:Assume good faith.The two users constantly harass and follow me to articles making disruptive edits in violation of numerous Wikipedia guidelines (WP:HARASS is just one). For example the removal of third party references from articles which don't suit their POV, without entering an edit summary (considered by Wikipedia guidelines as bad faith and a violation of WP:BLANK). The violation of WP:NEO by adding derogatory neologisms to the articles of organisations who they do not personally agree with, despite being made aware of the policy, despite not having any reference to the said organisation being described with said neologislm and despite the community majority constantly removing the derogatory term.  The same ""tag team"" practise can be shown to be used against numerous other editors who edit articles on British culture and trad counties, not just against me. Again, if you would like evidence just ask.It would seem however, looking at the messages on your talkpage above, especially the lovely intertude under ""UK mediation"" section, that Jza messaged you (somebody he seems very familiar with) in violation of WP:CANVAS.

" Socialistm? There are two important features of Smith's concept of the ""invisible hand"". First, Smith was not advocating a social policy (that people should act in their own self interest), but rather was describing an observed economic reality (that people do act in their own interest). Second, Smith was not claiming that all self-interest has beneficial effects on the community. He did not argue that self-interest is always good; he merely argued against the view that self-interest is necessarily bad. It is worth noting that, upon his death, Smith left much of his personal wealth to charity.Good!  Let's all make sure we put forth the idea that Adam Smith was a socialist.

"== Attributing and classifying of personalities == Invitation. Your input to Culture of Lithuania is welcomed. Some problems of defining personalities or attributing them to certain well-known ideological systems may raise here. I propose a quite liberal variant of it, where definition may not be connected with one certain word. Necessity however to follow certain classifying remains. My initial ideas on this branch, the ones, concerning period of Lithuanian national Renaissance period: Some artists, writers or other cultural workers of this period are often described as  modernists. This definition is not false, but some more concrete things should be added, some specifics of Lithuania. We should distinguish leading ideas of the Nat. Renaissance from later modernism, which is more known for us. Cultural aspirations of the later Nat. Ren. may be defined as  modernism in a cultural context of Lithuania. But they accented also expression of Lithuanian cultural heritage, and their expression may be seen as something simply typically  Lithuanian. I mean, that such authors in as  Čiurlionis is seen as modernist in Lithuanian context, but it also (and even more) is a representative of Lithuanian culture, when in European or World-wide context. A parallel  example may be taken from literature of India. Poet  Tagore, well known Nobel price winner is known for us as a representative of culture of India. Making India more understandable and closer for western people is concerned as main his input to Western culture. But in his own country, he was seen as a modernist too, who was changing traditional cultural forms, especially stagnated ones. This way also Lithuanian cultural leaders of the N. Ren. could be seen as modernists, which were broadening cultural forms and changing stagnated ones, in Lithuanian context. They also can be seen as modernists in a wider context, but more for acquainting Western people with Lithuanian culture than for their direct input into Western culture. Čiurlionis is the best example here. In other way, the later Lithuanian modernists (they depended mostly to later  generation, approximately from 4th decade of the 20th century) concerned themselves part of Western modernistic movement and their main purpose (looking generally) was  to introduce Western European ideas into Lithuanian cultural life (see the table below). We see two different movements and two different world outlooks here. The problem is, that both movements collaborated, especially their political wings did, and interchange of ideas between them is well seen. So, many researchers don't pay attention to this difference. Especially in the Soviet period, when national ideas were officially forbidden, mixture in description of these movements was allowed. E. g. philosopher Ramūnas Bytautas, who clearly depends to the first generation, is often described as liberal. And it may be understood in a sense of the second generation (as idea of liberalism).  period and generation  artists, writers, philosophers etc in a context of Lithuania in an European context The National Renaissance period, the younger generation, approx 1905 – 1930  painter and composer  Čiurlionis, painter Kazys Šimonis, poet and philosopher Vilius Storastas - Vydūnas, dramatist Sofija Kymantaitė - Čiurlionienė, poets Adomas Jakštas, Motiejus Gustaitis, Liudas Gira, composer Stasys Šimkus, philosopher Ramūnas Bytautas.  reformers and innovators of Lithuanian culture Representatives of Lithuanian culture, almost unknown before them.

And, of course, Peiser is more than just a social anthropologist.  He's one whose recent research has focused primarily on the social aspects of climate change and is thus at least as qualified to comment on the state of consensus as a historian.  Regarding his study, it hasn't been published in a peer-reviewed journal, but the results have appeared in many reliable sources.  In effect, it should be treated no differently than as if Peiser himself (or any other scientist) had verbally relayed the conclusions directly to a reporter.  Literally tens of thousands of Wiki articles contain such references direct quotes from scientists, which appear in no other source but through the medium of a reputable reporter.	0|0|0|0|0|0

I don't at all propose that it should be transcribed as [meːn] in this or any other article.  If anything at all, just a brief mention of the raising of TRAP and MOUTH in a pre-nasal environment would suffice.  I just thought it was an American thing to raise  before nasals (I do it myself), but I often hear Aussies do it quite a bit as well, and I don't hear English people do it at all.  The only difference is that Americans have a tendency to diphthongize it as well as raising it.  I'm not really surprised you don't have a broad accent, being a Wikipedian.  I'm not saying it's not possible.You're right; I was just kind of thinking aloud.	0|0|0|0|0|0
Homosexuals are intent on legitimizing their behavior. Therefore, they will seize any opportunity to suggest that famous persons are gay. In this way, their way of life will be received as being not only harmless, but perfectly normal. As generations of people grow from childhood to maturity and are exposed to this strategy, they increasingly develop a tolerance for homosexuality. In this way, it is now almost universally accepted as a diverse or alternate behavior or way of being, similar to a religion, race,  or nationality. Lestrade	0|0|0|0|0|0

It is common place for Wikipedians to help each other make better and a lot lesser bias edits and that is all i was trying to do. So if you wouldn't mind, please could you remove that warning.	0|0|0|0|0|0

" Randroide Answers to ""Next Step"" Guys, I do not see you taking steps to Wikipedia:Requests for mediation.I can not do this job because I always connect from ""filtered"" institutional net-access, and following those steps could result in new, undesired, controversial ""truncation"" of words by the software. I do not want that happenning.Could you please follow the instructions in the link I provided?. Thank you.  Randroide answers to New reference by Burgas00   At last we agree on something!...of course that the new section is a good idea: The false ""suicidal"" terrorists from PRISA will also be included there. Come oooooon, boys, start writing that section. I do not want all the kudos for myself: The new proposed article is, by now, an effort made only by me. But remember: NPOV and sources, all the sources. Just like me citing ""El País"" in the section about the doubts about the genuineness of the 13th bomb. Cheers   Indeed, a good point. And all the remarks in COPE too. And the ""moral certitudes"" of Mariano Rajoy published in El Mundo.  I agree with you 100%, Larean.  What Randroide omits to mention on the section about the 13th bomb is that he only added balancing references when I insisted that he do so, the original version he created was entirely POV, as is much of the rest of the proposed article. Also, all the sources that he added from El Pais are only available to subscribers - NPOV it is not.   You are right, Southofwatford, in your ""Randroide omits..."" section.If you have not subscription to ""El País"", I am sorry but that´s your problem. My ""institutional"" access also has some advantages, like paid access to ""El País"" (and many, many other publications and books). That´s one of the reasons for my exclusive use of ""filtered"" Internet accesss: It´s much easier for me to work here due to the easy availability of sources.Do you see?. The truncation of words is offsett (I think) by better sources.BTW, if you write under a ""Randroide answers"" section you are:Invading ""my"" space. I do not mind, really. But you are doing it.Risking new truncations on your messages. To avoid this, please write OUTSIDE ""Randroide answers"" sections.If you think that the proposed article is POV, work in it to make it NPOV. The article is not ""mine"".  I'll take the risk of you truncating the reply and put it here, it's very short. The issue is not whether I subscribe to El País, its whether the people who read an article in the English Wikipedia subscribe to it. All sources used should be accessible to all readers of the article, putting in a source that readers will not be able to see just so you can claim the article is NPOV is, to my mind, completely unreasonable.  All sources used should be accessible to all readers of the articleVery funny, Southofwatford. I am going to follow this joke of yours.Please propose also the deletion of all books as sources, because, did you know?, there is always someone without this or that book.Delete all references to TV or radio stations, because that user in Brazil has no TV and no radio at home.Delete all the references in spanish, because, did you know?, there are users who know no spanish.It´s a pleasure to read this kind of funny jokes, really. I had a good laugh.User:Southofwatford  How strange that you should find it so funny, after all most of the sources we are providing should enable users to find out more information about what is being sourced, so to deliberately choose sources that require those users to pay to see the information is not funny, it's simply bizarre. Equally, in the English Wikipedia I would argue that choosing a Spanish or other foreign language source when an equally valid source exists in English does not make sense, except perhaps to those who are too busy laughing - your cynicism is evident in your response. 08:3	0|0|0|0|0|0

"The organization of sub-topics. Culture is thrown way down towards the end, after economy and tourism, which is inappropriate. The information section is unnecessarily loaded with history and detailed geography, which makes it not only uninteresting, but also repetitive. Information is interspersed all through the sub-sections, without regard to whether or not they fit there. Eg, the Geography section starts with the fact that UP is the 5th largest state. That is not strictly geography, and belongs in the introduction. Climate belongs towards the latter part of the page, perhaps before toursim. Regions and cities is not such an interesting combination. In any case, ""Cities of Uttar Pradesh"" can be an interesting topic on its own, because, UP has several interesting cities (and regions) each with specialities of its own (like the copperware of Moradabad, ceramics of Khurja and carpets of Bhadohi). In fact I remember there used to be such information in the article before.(  )"	0|0|0|0|0|0
I don't know the answer to this, butLegally, how is it possible for a private citizen to violate another private citizen's civil rights?I don't know if this is the section Nelson was charged under in the federal case, but if anyone could explain this, I would appreciate it.You can argue whether or not the outcome of the state murder trial was justified, that's really not my concern here, since it's a dead letter.  I'm concerned about whether the subsequent civil rights prosecution was legal.  If the state murder acquittal was a miscarriage of justice, it's not the first time.  Look at Issei Sagawa.  Part of having a mature understanding of this sort of thing is to realize that the criminal justice system isn't perfect, and that it is inevitable that innocent people will be convicted, and that guilty people will be acquited, from time to time.  That's the price you pay for having a legal system; in the end someone has to make the decision, and sometimes they may not necessarily get it right.  I don't think it's going out on a limb to say that the Sagawa case is completely beyond all reasonable belief.	0|0|0|0|0|0

"I added information about Mayor de Blasio's announced decisions about Charter Schools but someone removed the factual information because they said it was not referenced.  It was factual but not referenced. I tired to add the information again with references but was not successful. I correctly added the race and sexuality of Chirlane McCray ONCE but someone (the same person who removed the factual information I provided under Charter Schools) was incredibly rude and stated it was ""vandalism"" and reported it.  How can this be and why are these descriptions considered negative?? Who decides what is ""reverted?"" On Chirlane McCray's own Wikipedia site the word ""black"" (I prefer African American) is mentioned SIX times and her sexuality is mentioned over and over again. These are not assertions at all and can be ""referenced"" by an approved Wikipedia site and Chirlane McCray's own important writings.  What is the problem?"	0|0|0|0|0|0

"Thanks for the copy-edit, OMG it reads so professional. ) I appreciate it a lot. Yeah, I knew that that would be a problem. Okay, here's the ""back story"" to it. Danny had body paint while he was a robot during a sketch. During the after party, in which the theme was a black light one, everybody could see that Danny still had paint on him, as it hadn't washed off or something. To be sure, Jack had a black light switch in his apartment, and when Liz came in, he turned it on, which resulted in Liz having the paint all over her, see here. Or if whatever I just said doesn't make sense, read here and here (about the paint still on Danny and the black light attack).Yeah, I thought maybe if people saw that, the GA note, they won't leave me a message.

The problem is that people keep trying to state that BSAs policies are this and that.  There is no policy that says homosexual scouts cannot be members.  To state otherwise is a lie and OR.  Just be it is a contraversy page doesn't allow you state lies or add OR, you can list things as misinterpretations of the rules and things like that but it you try to say scouting does this or scouting does that then you need to be sure scouting actually says that.  Even the misinterpretations of the rules need sources.  Just because an editor might misinterprete the rules doesn't mean anyone in mainstream has.  Can you find a source for somewhere where a homosexual youth was removed from the program just for being a openly homosexual youth?  Then insert it.  Unless you have it or an actual policy from BSA that says you can't be an openly homosexual youth member then what is being added is OR.	0|0|0|0|0|0

"66.185.85.80's rantPresently, we are witnessing  an open war against Croatian Dinaric culture.  Croatian Left often portrays this culture as ""primitive"" and ""rural"" (even ""fashist"") being  in  service of Conservative HDZ party. Croatian writer Predrag Raos, for instance, ""performed"" on gusle instrument in Zagreb on several occasions this year (2004) with only one intention - to ridicule the same instrument and its rich poetic tradition. Another ""apostle"" of Croatian Left - Miljenko Jergović - refers to his political opponents on the Right as ""gusle players"". Some even claim the Serbian origin of Croatian Dinaric culture following the line of traditional greater Serbian propagabda (all štokavian people and their culture are Serbian). However, Croatian Dinaric folklore and its rich gusle heritage is primarly Croatian. Dalmatian costal region has been historically associated with this culture. For example, the first written document about the most popular folk hero of traditional gusle music, Marko Kraljević, is associated with Dalmatian island Hvar through Petar Hektorović's book ""Ribanje i ribarsko prigovaranje"", 1568). Also, the first historical document which mentioned gusle player and its instrument originated in  Dubrovnik (1547). Even now, a contemporary Croatian writer (born in Dubrovnik) Stijepo Mijović Kočan tells us a story about his uncle (also from Dubrovnik area) who could memorize numerous gusle songs (Stijepo Mijović Kočan: Gusle, Glasnik, May 25, 1992, p. 42). Dubrovnik is also a home of Anica Begin (born Kalafatović, 1816), a daughter of famous gusle player Ante. Although illiterate, she was able to recite by heart an immense number of gusle songs, some of which were recorded in antology of Croatian folk poetry.  Not far from Dubrovnik, another coastal city - Makarska – was  also a bastion of Croatian gusle music. Actually, this region could be considered the Capital of all Croatian gusle players. This Mediterranean area  also gave birth to  Andrija Kačić Miošić (18th century Catholic priest), who is  viewed as the father of all gusle players of Croatia and beyond. To honour Kačić's work, Ivan Meštrović, the most famous Croatian sculptor, built a sculpture in America showing Kačić in his priestly clothes  playing gusle instrument.  In addition to Kačić, Makarska Littoral produced a great many other followers of Croatian gusle music. According to dr. fra Karlo Jurišić (who quotes the work of Croatian folklorist Stipan Banović), Zaostrog alone  produced a great number of gusle players starting with Stipan Kosović-Kudrić (1771-1818) and culminating with the most known Mate Banović – Trliš (1844-1915).  As for Dalmatian women, they didn't play gusle (it's    considered   a male activity only), yet they were actively involved in spreading  gusle music  by  imitating its sound. Olinko Delorko, the researcher of  Dalmatian  folk poetry in the 1960s, states in his book Ljuba Ivanova (1969) that most of his Dalmatian folk poetry collection was obtained by  women, especially the ones from the island of Hvar. The Zadar Littoral also witnessed strong gusle tradition. English writer Maude M. Holbach, travelling through Zadar region in the first decade of 20th century  states in her book  ""Dalmatia: The Land Where East Meets West"" that the gusle was the national instrument of the region. As for Dinaric dances, which took place at markets and certain festivals, they  are very picturesque and interesting, and worth going a long way to see, being a survival of ancient custom probably unique in Europe (p.54)This admiration for Dinaric folk music, particularly gusle, was seen in both Dalmatian Litteral and  Hinterland.  Matija Murko, the researcher of this literary/music forms,  had reported   that during his trips  through Dalmatia in the 1930s, he saw a child, barely three years old playing gusle (Eduard Osredečki: “Hrvatske narodne junačke pjesme”, Željezno-Beč, p. 9)Now, lets  take a look at  the names of some Dalmatian sports clubs and organizations: Hajduk, Junak, Gusar, Alkar, Uskok, sinjska alka, etc. What do they have in common? Of course, their names refer to the heroic gusle tradition of the region. Having this in mind, one wonders why this proud Croatian heritage has become almost  extinct.  Why do we have so few gusle players today ? Is it a  result of  unavoidable urbanization  of  modern Croatian society where peasant culture is being considered  inferior to global  rock 'n' roll  culture ? If so, why has tamburitza music of Northern Croatia  gained wide acceptance from the Croatian establishment while its  Dinaric counterpart (gusle music) is looked upon with suspicion and  open hatre	0|0|0|0|0|0

"The vote was on the Campbell Case but the primary reason was the Russian Treaties:""Baldwin was careful to emphasise that the Treaties were the substance of his objections. Standfordham wrote to the King, on 7 October, 'I saw Mr Baldwin who, in reply to my question ""Do you want to turn the Government out?"" said ""Yes, but not on the Campbell issue, but on the Russian Treaties which the country generally condemns."" He sees no alternative to a dissolution; it has always been expected, some wished for it before now, though he is opposed to hastening the Government's fall. ...' ... And it is true that only in the House of Commons were Baldwin's strictures based on the Campbell case – at Newcastle on 2 October he congratulated MacDonald on the agreement, achieved at a conference in London, on the Dawes Plan for reparations, and then spent the rest of the speech alternately pouring scorn on the Labour party's subservience to its extremists, and tearing to pieces the Russian agreement. But the final debate on 8 October was a mean Parliamentary occasion. Two days before, in a meeting which was something of a suave qui puet, the Cabinet decided to take it as a vote of confidence, preferring to go out on the Campbell case to a defeat on the Russian Treaties which might give the left wing too much prominence.—Middlemas and Barnes, p. 273.

The discussion of when there first were outdoor trees with electric lights is very strange. 1956? are you kidding? and some obscure town in NC? I don't think this makes much sense, especially since the sentences immediately preceding these establish that other cities had electrically lighted, outdoor Christmas trees in the early years of the 20th century. The article cited for the North Carolina town, if read carefully, really only states that the tradition of having outdoor lighted trees IN THAT SPECIFIC TOWN began in 1956, not that the town claims it was the first place to have such trees. I am old enough to have been around in 1956 (though I was a small boy) and I can tell you that we and our neighbors in Southern California had lighted, outdoor trees prior to 1956, and no one thought it remarkable or unusual. The history here is questionable, to say the least.	0|0|0|0|0|0

I don't think his argument is at all valid, but in the course of looking stuff up on the web I've discovered that some fans of the movie apparently consider the SG-1 series to be somehow illegitimate or non-canon.

The corner icons work beautifully, are much less distracting, and clicking them will follow you to a page explaining what the lock is for.I fully agree that the large box with text is very distracting and unnecessary.

They probably don't care that they can't edit the article, nor would they, and of most concern—they may confuse the tag with the article content.Thanks! +	0|0|0|0|0|0

Hi. The routes to Japan are often mis read. First, I had the argument that JAL flew to Tokyo, not JALways. But now I would like to challenge a route that Jetstar takes. It said the Jetstar flew to Kansai from Brisbane. This is true but you must connect through Sydney. Although you would stay on the same aeroplane, the flight number between BNE-KIX changes in Sydney meaning it is not a direct flight. EG: Flight 001, SYD-KIX. FLIGHT 002, KIX-SYD via BNE. That is how it works. If you are not sure, please check Qantas schedualing. I wont edit the page now in fear that I will be banned.	0|0|0|0|0|0

"  Thanks. From my point of view there are differences and parallels between the two concepts: One parallel is that both concepts are intending a territory with a homogeneous population. The difference is: the concept of racial hygiene is intending a homogeneous population regarding the criterium ""race"" (whatever ""race"" might be), the concept of ethnically homogeneous states is intending a homogeneous population regarding the criterium ""ethnicity"". A second difference is that the concept of racial hygiene has led to more extreme forms and methods in political practice in history (example: the holocaust - not only expulsion but also extinction of millions of people in an industrially organised process).

Well, I see FutPerf is getting quite angry now, insulting other editors also. And again their goal is make the point that the First Bulgarian Empire and the Second Bulgarian Empire are not Bulgarian or at least not related, which helps their long term strategy for the invention of a Macedonian nation and state, think Bulgarian Tsar Samuel, etc. which existed from antiquity and the middle ages. That's it. Tropcho, correctly pointed out that direct political continuity is completely unimportant for the info box, no other country cares for this in their info box, neither Spain, Germany, Ireland, Poland, etc. What is important is to show how Bulgaria formed thru the ages.	0|0|0|0|0|0

"Unfortunately, judging from previous ""warnings,"" some people here have a rather unusual view of what personal attacks are. Pointing out that the individuals accusing me of using sockpuppets were incorrect  and in fact the two main people making the accusations have been harassing me for months and had used sockpuppets and meat puppets themselves for getting around edit conflicts and to stack votes on a Request for Admin proceding, as pointed out by several editors at the time  certainly cannot be considered a personal attack. Pointing out that admins did not have any actual policy basis to make the blocks is not a personal attack (and it has, in fact, been confirmed by the overruling of the blocks more than once). Frankly, if you are looking for personal attacks, try yourself for your AGF-violating attacks on my actions based upon limited information and actually misleading information given to you by other individuals, or David Gerard for claiming that I am ""trolling"" when all i am doing is defending myself from false accusations of others. It's very clear that a number of people here need to realize that the very things they are accusing me of and trying to justify for a block are exactly what they themselves are doing from behind the pretense of trying to solve things.If you want to start blocking for incivility, I might suggest removing David Gerard for a while for his actions, or Elonka for falsely claiming that I was using sockpuppets or that I was harassing her, or the sysop whose very talk page says he's going to go around blocking people no questions asked and in fact did so after I caught him restoring placing illegal information on how to pirate software an article talk page.

When two people act in tandem (unintentionally or intentionally) to make the same revert four times, they may not technically violate the 3RR rule, but they certainly do so in spirit.

It is kjust a piece of dirty and lie facts presented and written by christian missionaries working to kill Turks and Kurds in 1910s. You can claim to be subject to genocide as much as you want. But this thing did never happen. Some armenian fundamentalists and fascists, who were killing Kurds, Turks and Azerbaijanis, were killed by great sons of the Turkic nation and I am proud of them.

Wrong! The capital is Podgorica as it has always been since July 13, 1946. The seat of government, parliament, AND PRESIDENT is in Podgorica. Cetinje is only the seat of the Kingdom of Montenegro in exile. And besides, only capital cities have embassies, and Podgorica has them and do you see any in Cetinje, no. Besides, no one in Montenegro nor in the world say that Cetinje is the capital of Montenenegro, but instead, they say it is Podgorica. And also, that consitution was adopted in 1992, very outdated, and a new one is due next year.	0|0|0|0|0|0

" Can there be a more concise listing? The listing of ""other inventions"" is profoundly vague. Why group 4 different categories together? Why even mention things that the chinese received purely from outside sources? There should be a much more complete, well managed list of chinese developments, which I've yet to find- along with how these were transmitted globally, and whether or not places like Europe got them purely from the Chinese.This really needs the attention of people with some remote expertise, which I guess is somewhat there when Needham's work, which is profoundly rare in private collections was cited- not like the arrogant bigoted ass who was crying about chinese nationalism, yet then went onto say that they only invented noodles.And besides, why are things like the cannon and porcelain listed under ""other inventions""? Who developed these independently?"	0|0|0|0|0|0
In history there could be a consensus view or a mainstream view, in theology there is no mainstream or consensus view, since most of theology depends upon the church membership of the theologian. Historical scholarship aims at universality and objectivity, while theology makes no such claims. It is true that there are millions who believe that JEDP was birthed in hell (or would believe it if they knew what JEDP means), so in principle their view is notable, but as Enns said, it is a fringe view in the academe, even among scholars who actually disagree with JEDP. The sources used to build Wikipedia are academic sources, therefore JEDP and its 20-21st century offspring are given by default the weight they have inside the academia, while the view of the fundamentalists is treated according to WP:UNDUE. This does not mean that Wikipedia could say that the fundamentalists are theologically wrong (Wikipedia has no theology of its own), but it is entitled to say that inside historical scholarship they are a fringe view. Of course, this does not exclude serious scholarship done at religious faculties, since as Ehrman said in one of his bestsellers, US mainline Protestant and Catholic theological seminaries and divinity schools do teach mandatory historical criticism classes. So, in a sense, scholars from such faculties are thoroughly acquainted with historical criticism and built their careers upon its assumptions. Only fundamentalist seminaries and divinity schools choose to default against historical criticism. They are free to do this, but this cuts against their claims of being mainstream historians.	0|0|0|0|0|0

If you wish to get your own pix of all the concerned images, you're damn welcome to try, but they are GFDL therefore there's no grounds for removal.

After multiple revisions of LEGITIMATE edits which I made to ""his"" articles, I told him to leave me alone. He proceeded to foul my discussion page with unwanted and unsolicited comments. When I objected to this, he goaded me into calling him a profanity.While I respect your role as a Wikipedia Administrator, I'd like to respectfully request that in the future, you exercise better discretion when blocking a user based on one-sided information.

Keep your chin up! Darwinism was not accepted over-night. There appears to be more sense in  the  AAT origins, than the sort-cut hypothesis that our  ancestors went from swinging in trees to the prairies (and then, eons later, take up a sedentary life style so they could edit Wikipedia and face book etc., all day). One only has to watch little kids on the beach.  The first time a wave throws them bottom-over-elbow they may well cry – but after a time,  they can't wait to get into the water again. It is as if  being at home on a sea-edge environment is hard-wired into their genes.  Unfortunately, the rise in sea level since these times means that evidence of these coastal communities may never be found.  Keep plugging away until the old hypothesis fade away.	0|0|0|0|0|0

While I agree that Indus valley civilisation is the correct name for the civilisation, the passage quoted above is not neccecarily factual in terms of saying Second there is no proof at all that the mighty Sarasvati of the Rigveda was in fact this (now dry) river- the identification is itself open to doubt.. Apart from there being facts/proof to indicate that Saraswati did exist as this dry river ( including geological facts as to why it dried up) The evidence also points to the fact that it was NOT a tributary of the Indus, ( refuting point 3 of the passage quoted above ) and in fact drew the waters of the Sutlej and the Yamuna to be a river system of it's own. And though a large number of sites have been found along this river system, none of them are of the scale of Harrapa / Mohenjodaro, leaving the Indus Valley tag as the correct one. Saraswati did exist,today the timing is disputed and not the existence, Wheter it is vedic and indic vs Harrapan and non vedic is more disputed today than it's existence.	0|0|0|0|0|0

Hi Fracophonie,Thanks for taking the time to write such a long message - I appreciate this.In terms of what I said about the age - I didn't mean to cause offense. I thought I read somewhere that you had to be over 18 to make these decisions but I think I was getting confused with the check user privileges. I have already read some of those policies but will read the rest later today. I am not a troll - I just need time to get used to all these acronyms, policies etc.From what started out with me writing an article about my favourite website has turned into a massive thing which was not what I was expecting.I really don't have any more time to argue and debate with the usrs since its clear they just want it deleted despite what I have said. For example one user just wrote there is another site called Amirite.net. This is Amirite.com!! This is precisely why I had to keep responding on the AFC delete page. In terms of the rest I agree to do them (of course I can only apologise once I am unblocked) - can you apologise for me?On a side note I am actually French and Jewish (shame about the gay part though:)	0|0|0|0|0|0

I removed the content, after it was tagged as uncited by Mattisse. If every commonly known fact need a cite because some editor-en passent wants to nominate for FARC, then it appears we have a problem. I very much suspect Mattisse's motives here, but frankly, I am too tired of her to be bothered to explore them. Perhaps one of her probabtionary mentors, more interested in her than I, would care to deal with this.	0|0|0|0|0|0

":::::::::: Tim, firstly I appreciate you taking the time to discuss this issue offline, and for your willingness to debate it at length here despite the majority view here being in your favour. Yes I certainly agree with your friend that it is very important to describe the jurisidictions that a firm is present in, there is clearly a massive diffence between, say having offices in the French or Japanese jurisdictions, or between the Chinese and U.S. jurisdictions, since the legal and regulatory systems are very different, as well as the commercial characteristics of the markets. Beyond that however it remains my firm view that there is a big difference between a law firm having an office in, say, Paris or Toulouse, even though they are both in the same jurisdiction. I appreciate that the situation in the U.S. is slightly more complex since you have both federal and state jurisdictions. Even within each state there will be big differences between the legal markets in different cities though. To give an example, the San Jose market will be not just a lot smaller overall than the Los Angeles market, but it will also have a quite different profile - on the whole a lot more specialist, niche and focused on high tech.  To give another example, in the UK a law firm could never be regarded as being truly top tier if it didn't have an office in London, even if it had offices in every other big city. In fact all of the very top tier UK firms (DLA Piper is not yet regarded as one of them, despite its size) have just one UK office, in London, although they have other offices overseas.  Saying that DLA has "" has 69 offices across the United States, Egypt, South Africa, Kenya, Thailand, China, ..."" would in my view still mean a loss of valuable information to the reader. We could fall back on using descriptions like ""in major financial centres"" or ""in major commercial centres"" or ""in a combination of major financial centres and major commercial centres"" but then we are introducing what is in my view an unnecesssary element of vagueness, imprecision and even original research. I do accept that DLA, with 69 offices, is right on the borderline of having too many offices to make it practical to list all of them in the article. However I do also feel that there is an important general point of principal that information about the office locations of a law firm is very valuable information to aid the reader of an article in understanding the subject of it, and should be included as much as possible.

No problem with that at all!

"Speedy deletion of Andrew takao A tag has been placed on Andrew takao requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for biographies. If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or ""db"" tag), coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

"Nope, I didn't read the guide to appealing, didn't have time. The user in question IS engaged in harassment, I've been doing this long enough to know and I can prove it. He/she immediately placed a threatening notice of blocking me permanently on my user page, reverted the article while I was in the midst of editing it (my second pass, couldn't even preview changes), then changed his/her mind as to my real wiki-sin, since the onus for proving the Doris Day available as PD on archive.org was on him/her not me and the usual span for pre-Bern had expired long ago, ... decided my REAL sin was Original Research (oh noes), and continued to revert based on that. Does OR add clutter? Sure it can, but if the user in question was REALLY concerned about that, about the quality of the article and about extraneous details, WHY DIDN'T HE/SHE EVEN NOTICE two paragraphs already there, comprising about 1/3 of the entire article, dealt with Norman Schwarzkopf, an unrelated book and an unrelated ice cream store name? I'll tell you why: the user wasn't engaged in good-faith/goodwill editing and the normal back-and-forth that leads to better articles. He/she was involved in blocking input to the article. Why? Was it personal against me, or was it to preserve the existing content of the article, including the false claims and extraneous material not even concerned with ther subject at hand? I can only speculate, but I'd guess it's some sort of power trip and wiki-bullying. I don't really have time for this. I have made a fair number of very good edits over the years and have usually refrained from saying anything that isn't directly related to content and improving articles. I could pretend this user didn't do what he/she did, but I'm wasting my own time here and I don't really have a stake in any such pretense. I don't have any stake in improving this article either, no dog in the race, I just see how it can be improved and made more informative. As a long-term wikipedia user and editor, I don't see any problem in jumping in and fixing something. I almost expect some sort of pushback now, but not over completely minor edits which are very good and on-target in very minor stub-like articles. The problem isn't me here, it's that if people such as the user in question can get away with this sort of behavior, and they are getting away with it, wikipedia becomes a much poorer place, a playground filled with bullies rather than a library where we can all learn and share. Also, I don't recal ever having called him/her a bot, I think you put those words in my mouth, perhaps inadvertently. His/her behavior is malicious, but probably not malware, just the normal human collection of problems. I think this user should be warned against trying to be a gatekeeper, he/she isn't quite qualified for that at this point anyway, and it's having a very chilling effect across wikipedia. I won't egnage in a battle of the wikipedia rule acronyms, I will continue to write in English, and to read articles on wikipedia in English, and to think of ways to improve them in English. I am fully aware of how the terms ""vandlism"" are used and misused here, and most of the rest of the wikijargon. Nothing new under the sun here. If you read the edits I made carefully, and note the times of the reverts and the history of actions by that other user, you will see I'm not off the mark here at all. I know what's going on. I don't know why, but I don't have to, and I expect the motivations aren't interesting. Respond if you have anything to say.   "	0|0|0|0|0|0

Summary of situation  User:ShimShem has taken a dislike to this article, and has tried numerous methods to either get it deleted or its name changed.  1) Completely invalid speedy deletion request 2) Invalid DRV request 3) Nominated for deletion via AfD, despite the fact that it had passed an AfD this year - in fact the AfD was withdrawn at 6-0 for Keep The current AFD here stands at 9-0 for Keep, but despite that, ShimShem has wikilawyered all the way through it - once it became clear that it was going to be kept, they decided a name change would be better... 4) Changed the name of the band in the article, and was told to take it to talk After a brief non-discussion on talk, moved the article anyway, and was revertedI was originally unsure of the motives of this editor - why they were completely desperate to delete or move this article - until I noted they were interested in Tamil subjects, one of which is M.I.A. (artist), and guessed that they believed that the two could be confused.  Their subsequent creation of the article M I A as a redirect to M.I.A. (artist) proved this, as far as I am concerned.  As to whether the band is actually called MIA or M.I.A., it differs.  The band itself uses M.I.A. as the heading on their own website, but then uses a combination of both elsewhere.  Since in the case of most sources, this is only likely to be laziness (much as R.E.M. are regularly referred to as REM), and since the article has existed here for a while, and that all the backlinks go to this version, and most of all because we shouldn't let disruptive users get their way, the article should stay here.	0|0|0|0|0|0
" It is unnecessairy source, because it does not matter how many soldiers were killed. What matters is that the Safavids were deposed. Besides that, mentioning that information WITHOUT making any remarks about the brutality of the Afghan forces - for example the complete massacre of the Safavid family (including women and children), as well as the massacres on the civilian population in Isfahan, Bam, and villages of Khorasan - is considered POV.  Besides that, you have not shown any sources for your claim that ""30000-100000 soldiers were killed"".  And as for the edits: it does not matter what YOU believe, it only matters what the Wikipedia rules are.

However, its missing the part where Milo's son is laying on his belly unconscious on a bed, Milo anally rapes him while several masked men watch. Also, there's some use of a knife/sword in this scene. This is truly one sick film. No, there is no artistic message. This film is basicly a middle finger by the sick-minded film makers.

Large ships are typically launched into the water when the hulls are completed, but that doesn't mean all of the construction work is finished. Usually, there is still a significant amount of work to be done, including finishing the interior of the ship, building the superstructure, etc. Take a look at Image:SMS Seydliz under construction.jpg, for example; you can see the ship is already in the water, but a significant amount of work is being done to the superstructure.

4meter4's sigh and my concerns Only because Mr 4meter4 had reverted any of contributions of mine given to this article so far I did not have a single chance to develop it. His article called ¨falsetto¨ is not about falsetto. It may be about his arrogance, who knows. There are a huge contraries regarding only the definition of falsetto. There are many signs of entirely different falsetto compare those info which Mr 4meter4 such anxiously protects. In England, Italy or Spain 16th century were described entirely different types of falsettos. On the top of it, Mr 4meter4 perhaps never heard Pavarotti singing falsetto, or the falsetto of Ian Gillan. Singing of King Diamond is based on falsetto. What about Michael Kiske? Is it not falsetto? Mariah Carey or Whitney Houston do (did) not sing falsetto? Does any of these falsettos sound breathy? Not to me. Isn't out there published a note about those? Maybe only because 4meter4 does not look for it. Why? It would not fit to his article. He would have to admit that his ONLY source Vennard was probably having in the chair something else than falsetto or he was drunk. 4meter4 quickly opened two or three books and things he had swallowed the World. The whole physiology of his ¨only¨ falsetto is based on encyclopedia? Well, perhaps it is enough for Wikipedia or himself. But not for me. No. There is much more out there only regarding physiology. Much much more. And just because you allow idiots like 4meter4 to ¨develop¨ Wikipedia, the people, the readers of Wikipedia will read shit. Where are any proves of the research regarding female falsetto at 60ies, Mr Know Everything? Feel free to block me again. I have no desire to write here any more.	0|0|0|0|0|0

" Removed POV I removed undo criticism of Secretary Boutwell and POV. Wikipedia is not meant to bash persons reputations whether alive or dead. The following has been removed from the article.""Boutwell did little to withdraw paper currency from circulation, shaping his financial policy to forestall either inflation or deflation.  Intellectual critics saw in these actions a want of guiding principle and a lack of solid theoretical knowledge. ""He believed in knowledge just so far as it was convenient for him to justify his own theory that knowledge was a deception,"" Henry Adams wrote in a much-quoted analysis in 1870. ""He believed in common schools, and not in political science; in ledgers and cash-books, but not in Adam Smith or Mill; as one might believe in the multiplication-table, but not in Laplace or Newton. By a natural logic he made of his disbelief in the higher branches of political science a basis for his political practice, and thus grounding action on ignorance he carried out his principle to its remotest conclusions.""Henry Adams, ""The Session,"" North American Review, July, 1870, p. 36.  But in a very corrupt time, it spoke well of Boutwell that nobody thought that he made money out of his Cabinet post, either for himself or his friends. Living within his salary, he lodged in a boarding-house throughout his tenure. His only pleasures lay in writing lectures and playing billiards or poker   though never for money. Chicago Times, March 6, 1875.  ""He is an inaccessible man, uninfluenced by fear, favor, affection or hope of reward, and does not burst out into brillian exhibitions of love or hatred,"" a New England politician wrote his brother. Henry F. French to Benjamin B. French, March 16, 1869, Benjamin B. French Papers, Library of Congress.""Boutwell's financial policy was less dogmatic than pragmatic.""Liberal reformers had hoped that he would embrace civil service reform and rush the country towards the resumption of specie payments; but while Boutwell appointed subordinates on the basis of merit for the most part, , he did little to rein in the spoils system outside of Washington, remaining on friendly terms with the party bosses.''"""	0|0|0|0|0|0

" Question on Possible Citation I'm sorry if I missed your question - I don't pay much attention to that page. In response to your question, let me start by repeating my boilerplate formulation: The job of Wikipedia editors is to verifiably summarize reliable sources using the neutral point of view. (I haven't yet worked in ""no original research"".) WP:NOR says that we mustn't integrate otherwise reliable information to arrive at novel conclusions. Comparing two lists and drawing conclusions from their differences and similarities is most likely original research. We can integrate information, so long as we don't arrive at new theories. Another principle to remember is that vagueness improves accuracy. The more precise we are the harder it is to be accurate. Getting down to details, the Predators and Editors website appears to be a reliable source so we can use it as a source. The Bauer site, even if somewhat unreliable, may be used in a limited fashion as a primary source about Bauer. I'm not familiar enough with this topic to make pronouncements on what would be correct. However I would say that your proposed text appears reasonable. The sources are sufficient, and no original conclusions are made. The website takedown issue is confusing to me, but you should be able to summarize what you find in reliable sources. Overall, my opinion is that the less we say about the subject the better. Attack articles are not encouraged. While we must show our subjects ""warts and all"" we shouldn't enlarge the warts, nor ignore their better features. Balance is a part of NPOV. - ""but you should be able to summarize what you find in reliable sources."" There no reliable sources only a he said she said blog flame war. It is alleged the website takdown was instigated by Bauer. It isn't clear if she did, and other factors between the forum and the IP are not known. It was the root cause of this article and all the players here were involved via these blogs. I don't see how that can be objective.  Bauer I'm sorry I did not get back to you about the Usenet stuff et al., but I've been somewhat overloaded at work. Personally, I think the article is better now than when I first saw it, thanks to a lot of effort on the part of the primary editors of the article to bring the best sources and present them in a way that doesn't seem like a lynch mob. Y'all are doing a good job, and there should be enough editors on either side to ensure that something resembling nuetral gets posted . I'm glad to help and try and make the article neater, and I don't mean to sound brusque in the summary field, but there was a lot to cram in there. Thanks for the note, I appreciate it!    I would say Karen saying I've called her names is an out and out fabrication. I've never done any such thing. ""or whether it's because he's been able to insult me and call me names on Wikipedia, repeatedly and without consequences""I've accused her and Jule of carrying the water for TNH and Absolutewrite and they have. That isn't namecalling by a long stretch. I'm really weary of these attacks over this. This is mob rule. While avi seems genuine, she's hanging with a tough insulting tribe. The threats against me are real and escalating by the hour. Blaming me won't make my points any less valid. Nobody likes to be piled on by a crowd. It's the Internet equivalent of stoning.

" Another crap article Parrots what promotion websites of capoeira schools say about myths of origin. And also that persecution thing. By the late 1800s, capoeira became a word for street brawling.

No decent carioca would be eager to sympathise with capoeira and malandrismo. I could attempt to alter the article but it's become such a mess by now.   "	1|0|0|0|0|0

"""For Security Reasons"" edit warAs I said in my edit summary, the term ""For Security Reasons"" is ambiguous and not properly established in the source. Further, it is unnecessary. You'd have to have a crystal ball to know why they did it and, as I said earlier, Janes is not perfect.  The reason that all the other MG manufacturers alter their parts so they don't interchange is because the US BATFE makes them do it.  Suddenly, Glock is different?  Yeah, I guess that's just like Glock compensated pistols not acting like any other compensated pistol. I wonder if they actually shoot bullets?   "	0|0|0|0|0|0

Noel, you are an expert.  Please convince Whig history fans (or the lazy minds) about how Bonnie Prince Charlie did not want to dissolve the Union, that the United Kingdom began with the Stuarts as opposed to the Hanoverians.  Tell them how the Whigs rewrote history to blame everything on the Stuarts, whom are credited as ultimate failures with no positive contributions to the foundations of Great Britain in their Stewart and Tudor blood.  The Sovereign's will is the Realm, or else it is not a kingdom.  The British might as well be living in a republic, at least if the Parliamentarians had their way.  Even the Hanoverian heirs recognise that the Stuarts founded the UK.  Please debate that here & thanks.	0|0|0|0|0|0

" Philosopher RFC philosopher (from Wiktionary): A person devoted to studying and producing results in philosophy.I am going to make the case that we must call Stefan Molyneux a ""philosopher"" (without qualifiers) in the lead.  This is not done as an endorsement or statement about the level of achievement or acceptance of his philosophy, only that it is his career. (Note: Not all of the sources I use below are in the article at present. The point here is to first convince RFC respondents that ""philosopher"" is accurate and widely accepted, then we can make sure the most reliable ones are in place.) Definitions Obviously, each source is going to use slightly different phrasing. Some will call him explicitly a ""philosopher"" or has views on ""philosophy"", but I think you should consider some other phrases given below as equivalent. Using one word ""philosopher"" in the lead sentence covers all of his political, ethical, and theistic specializations in one word, which we then elaborate on later in the article. ""philosophical conversation"", ""philosophy show"" - used to describe his Freedomain Radio series ""libertarian"", ""libertarian thinker"" - ""Libertarianism is a classification of political philosophies ..."" ""anarcho-capitalist"" - ""Anarcho-capitalism ... is a political philosophy..."" ""voluntaryist"" - ""Voluntaryism (or sometimes voluntarism), is a libertarian philosophy..."" ""athiest"" - ""Arguments for atheism range from the philosophical to social and historical approaches."" ""ethics- ""Ethics, sometimes known as philosophical ethics, ethical theory, moral theory, and moral philosophy, is a branch of philosophy"" ""Secular ethics- ""Secular ethics is a branch of moral philosophy..."" Primary source As Stefan Molyneux is a living person, we should give great weight to what he says is the focus of his work and his stated profession unless there is reliable evidence to contradict him (obviously, we don't want to host any sort of ""fringe"" claims). If we are to dispute what he says about himself, though, then we absolutely must have a strong basis for this, or we open Wikipedia to discredit or liability - this is why BLPs are held to strong standards in the first place. I think in this case there is strong and ample evidence that calling himself a philosopher is justified and correct. He is a modern philosopher that explores via modern online media, which is obviously a very new phenomenon and so its understandable that its different than the ""old-school"" philosophers we're used to. Freedomain Radio ""About"" page - ""my Master's Thesis analyzing the political implications of the philosophies "", ""I have been fascinated by philosophy - particularly moral theories - since my mid-teens. I left my career as a software entrepreneur and executive to pursue philosophy full time through my work here at Freedomain Radio. I have written a number of novels as well as many free books on philosophy."" Freedomain Radio (the show that Molyneux hosts) has the tagline ""The Largest and Most Popular Philosophical Conversation in the World""*  Molyneux's books show that he is endeavoring to produce tangible written results in the field of philosophy, particularly Universally Preferable Behaviour (UPB): A Rational Proof of Secular Ethics and Against the Gods? A Concise Guide to Atheism and Agnosticism which are two of his more ""deep dives"" into the fundamental philosophies.

NigelPer wiki standards - when to use and external link: 1) Is it proper in the context of the article (useful, tasteful, informative, factual, etc.)?  2) Is it a functional link, and likely to continue being a functional link?  3) Each link should be considered on its merits, using the following guidelines. As the number of external links in an article grows longer, assessment should become stricter. When in doubt about the appropriateness of adding new links, make a suggestion on the article's talkpage and discuss with other editors.I generally avoid external links except when it takes me directly to the home page of the aircraft in question - this link does take me directly to NASM's page on this particular P-61 - that makes this external link appropiate.  Agree that this page does need more references.	0|0|0|0|0|0

request for help = request for help Hi again Cat, as perviously I have noticed a strong anti-Greek bias on several articles related to Macedonia. I've had issues with both Furper and Beam... who seem to be admins that heavily favour FYROM. I've officially complained on the notice board about their threats to block, edit behavior and unusually close relationships with obvious FYROM POV members of Wikipedia.  (specifically Balkanfever) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard#This_anon_.28apparently_User:Crossthets.29.2C_is_an_apparent_POV_Pusher.2C_evidence_belowAs I said verbatim on Politis talk_page...This is a difficult battle because so far I am alone at the moment, I am a newbie, and as I said to one of the admins on notice board... I feel like someone reporting a bad cop at a policeman's ball.  However, I still plan to follow up soon with a precise listing of what I perceive as non-NPOV behavior by these admins. I noticed while researching this issue you've also have problems with them. Would it be possible to list any problems on your talk page here so I can add them to my report to show I am not alone? Furthermore... since you have been around longer you probably know more Greeks than me around here. Would it be possible to also contact them to ask them if they've also had problems with those two... and (if so) add those incidents to your list?  (and perhaps get them to contact others?) Where one person could be bullied with threats of blocking... the concerns of many will be taken much more seriously. I will check back here in a couple of days. Have courage.

" Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Cheongye Kwan Your post at the above AFD on a new martial art bothers me. This was the version at the time, that you based your post on. You posted: ""I just read the article, and to be quite honest, feel that it does satisfy Wikipedia's guidelines... it is reliably sourced... Since I believe the notability of the article is satisfied... It now has 11 independent sources. And to refute the argument posed by Wayne, it is determined by the Phillip Rhee source that the martial arts is not localised"".Please consider the concerns this post raises. Simple matters like references, notability and noobie basics of AFDs should be routine for any moderately experienced user, and bread-and-butter for any admin. In fact a cursory check shows that almost everything you stated was.. I don't have a word for it. ""Unreal"" is close.The ""eleven independent sources"" that you stated established notability and non-localization at the time, were: Three references from 2004 [coates, robinson, shaw], certainly before the topic even existed (!) and all related to a passing piece of news about its founder being on the team of a completely different sport in any event (!) Two references from 1st half 2005 [davies, white], almost certainly identical and identically irrelevant to the topic's notability. The promoter's personal page on his local town website, almost certainly self-published [official village website].

" stradbroke galleon / portuguese hallo Moondyne, I do admit that when I signed onto Wikipedia I was not aware that it was a concensus community of knowledge Nazis but now that I am aware of it I will make the appropriate adjustments. I was under the obviously mistaken impression that Wikipedia was a venue for sharing facts, knowledge and information. The notion that the Stradbroke Galleon story is a pet theory of mine is total rubbish as it has been written about, discussed and investigated for more than 100 years by historians and historical groups such as the Royal Historical Society of Queensland, the Maritime Archaeology Association of Queensland and many more too numerous to include here. There exists, in various libraries, books and communities a large body of written and oral history concerning the galleon story which I have attempted to fairly and accurately place in the WP domain. The fact that a story is not accepted by ""mainstream"" academics is not a valid reason for deletion of either of my contributions. What has occured here is a classic example of manipulation of an information resource by a vested interest group (i.e. Hesperian and his friends) who are representatives of the ""mainstream"" view. Hesperian complain about the media coverage I have recieved but this never appeared in any of the WP contributions I made and Hesperian's mention of the media coverage demonstrates the core reason for Hesperian's antagonistic attitude, simple, old fashioned professional jealousy. Thus valid historical data is being deliberately surpressed by Hesperian for personal reasons. For example the Portuguese walking stick handle which was found in an Aboriginal midden, identified by a Spanish Musuem offical and story told to me by a UQ Archaeology PhD student is very relevant to the theory of the Portuguese discovery of Australia. This kind of knowledge suppression is not what Wiki is about but I guess you do not care as you appear to be part of the happy little click or have been sucked in by Hesperian and his little band of mates, which is a pity, but history is full of the suppression of information by vested interest groups so why should I expect Wiki be any different. Still it is dissapointing. Happy trails.    "	0|0|0|0|0|0

Accents Although the cartoon established Mario and Luigi to be from Brooklyn (a fact commonly accepted by fans, despite having never been mentioned in any games), Toad seemed to speak with a thicker Brooklyn accent.  The accents weren't mentioned in the games, but the TV show was (presumably) a licensed product.  Until Nintendo decided to go with an Italian accent, fans assumed the TV show (and later the movie) accent was the official standing.  Only when Nintendo's products included digitized recorded speech did anyone realize Nintendo intended them to be Italian, not Italian-American.  It's the same principle of updated canon that Star Trek and Star Wars licensed products run on.	0|0|0|0|0|0

Or between the French and the Walloons. Surprise, our article on French people clearly labels the Walloon as a distinct ethnic group... Perhaps it is best not to make comparisons?   After screwing it up a few times, I have done rewrites of parts of the article (mainly a word and a sentence left and right) to make the distinction and relation between the Dutch and the Flemish clearer. The article switched constantly between parts about the Dutch only, and parts about the Dutch and Flemish together. This should now be clearer. The major thing left to adjust are the graphs of the number of Dutch, since these still al include the Flemish.	0|0|0|0|0|0

"I do not see any anti-semitism here.

" Why confusion and controversy in the ""real world"" does not preclude the writing of a good Wikipedia on the topic Ackoz suggests that, because the real world has not yet hashed out ""the truth"" about the expulsions, it is therefore impossible for us to know the truth and thus impossible for us to write about it.I reject such a stance.  I think it is difficult but quite possible to write a quality Wikipedia article about a topic that is murky and/or controversial.  Where many Wikipedia editors ""get it wrong"" is that they believe Wikipedia's job is to report the truth.  This is wrong.  Wikipedia's job is not to report the truth precisely because it is difficult to determine what the truth is.  Any attempt to do that is original research.Instead of ""truth"", Wikipedia aims for ""verifiability"".  Put a different way, Wikipedia is committed to recording the state of human knowledge and opinion (not our opinions but those of reliable sources).  If the truth is clear and uncontroversial, it is easy for us to report that.  If the truth is murky and controversial, it is more challenging but possible for us to report on what different reliable sources assert and think about a topic EVEN if these reliable sources conflict.  Where Wikipedia editors get into trouble is when they start siding with one side of a controversy and asserting that the side that they have selected represents ""THE TRUTH"" and not just one perspective (or POV) on the topic at hand.I have been trying to hit this NPOV ""sweet spot"" but it is difficult to do so in the midst of a running polemical debate between the two sides. Obviously is, because some users (Jadger and Wikiferdi) don't want to discuss in fact, they want us to agree with their POV, that's not discussion about the NPOV edits. That's why I quit from the discussion about the form of the article. ≈talk≈ "	0|0|0|0|0|0

"::::::Agreed, although it means bloating the alternative title by yet another word. I was concentrating on the Polish attitude here, as it clearly provides the starting point for the article at hand. Obviously, if the article is to be written from a supra-national perspective, at least the Czech experience needs to be included. Czechoslovakia, being the only functioning democracy in the region by the 1930s, had closer ties with the West than Poland did, and was ""betrayed"" in a much more obvious and tangible way than Poland was: The West politically accepted the country's territorial mutilation, which was not the case with Poland. That said, I am not sure if the inclusion of countries such as Finland, the Baltics, Yugoslavia, or even Ukraine (which had never been independent in the first place) is a good idea. While the West could have arguably done more to assist any of these societies before and after the war, I think that the article's focus should be on Poland and Czechoslovakia in order not do dilute the whole issue. After all, there were dissidents in Germany and the Soviet Union, too, who were harbouring grudges towards Western politicians because of their appeasement policy.  19:06, 17 Oct 2004 (UTC)"	0|0|0|0|0|0

"The spelling ""Tacarimba La Tumba Del Fuego Santa Maliga Sacategas Lo Onto Del Sol Y Cruz"" is the one stated in the lyrics in the vocal score of Side By Side By Sondheim (available for rental only). This version of the song, however, misspells Llanfair PG (presumably to approximate the pronunciation), and has the lyric ""...today's the last I'll be spreading"" rather than ""spending"". It would seem, therefore, that this source cannot be considered canonical. This rendering of the place name does accord with Millicent Martin's recording on the Side By Side By Sondheim cast album, however.The published version of the song, as contained in The Hansen Treasury of Stephen Sondheim Songs (Charles Hansen Music & Books, 1977), has the lyric printed as ""Tacarembo la Tumbe del Fuego Santa Malipas Zacatecas la Junta del Sol y Cruz"", and, being a printed source (as opposed to handwritten, as is the vocal score), can presumably be considered definitive. Linda Lavin's pronunciation on the original cast recording of The Mad Show (for which the song was written) follows this spelling, which would suggest that the printed version is correct.As it is a fictional place name, however, any discussion of ""correct"" spelling/pronunciation is an academic one, at best."	0|0|0|0|0|0

"Speedy deletion of Phi Rho Eta A tag has been placed on Phi Rho Eta requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section G12 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be a blatant copyright infringement. For legal reasons, we cannot accept copyrighted text or images borrowed from other web sites or printed material, and as a consequence, your addition will most likely be deleted. You may use external websites as a source of information, but not as a source of sentences. This part is crucial: say it in your own words.If the external website belongs to you, and you want to allow Wikipedia to use the text — which means allowing other people to modify it — then you must include on the external site the statement ""I, (name), am the author of this article, (article name), and I release its content under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 and later."" You might want to look at Wikipedia's policies and guidelines for more details, or ask a question here. If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the article (just below the existing speedy deletion or ""db"" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

"I think Clockback that your suggested reference to Ainsworth’s involvement in the IMG is too long and that something along the lines of ‘brief flirtation’ would be better. I think that the IMG reference needs to be short/somewhere in the early career section/posted after the article has been expanded a little, otherwise the article might appear weighty. I think the last point is important as it seemed to be a consensus reached by a number of Wikipedia editors after much wrangling and gnashing of teeth))But bedsides, this brief dalliance with Marxism, in an overall consideration of his political career, pales into insignificance compared to his being controversially thrust as a third choice candidate into the position of Defence Secretary at a time of crisis for the British Army in terms of the number of casualties being sustained and a lack of resources. This is simply not reflected at all in the Ainsworth article. I tried reflecting it as follows: ""His appointment formed part of a chaotic cabinet reshuffle by the Prime Minister, who ""considered at least three other candidates before appointing Ainsworth"" but this was dismissed as ""speculative opinion"" by Off2riorob above, even though from my point of view it is easily the most significant event in Ainsworth’s biography. Perhaps we can reach a consensus that if a better reference can be found—which I suspect should not be difficult—that it can be re-included? I want to stress that this is again not meant to be an ad hominem slight against Ainsworth, but merely drawing attention to the fact that his appointment was the equivalent of throwing someone in at the deep end (and indeed he has had a very difficult time of it since his appointment). Actually it reflects worse on Brown and the farcical reshuffle.  "	0|0|0|0|0|0
" Greek love I'm looking for a way to extricate myself honorably from this mess. I'm leaving a note here because you closed this AfD, where I made a commitment to do as you instructed in the closing statement. There are two editors who have long sought to delete or eviscerate the article, one of whom has used a series of user names (unacknowledged on his current user page but available , so at first glance it may appear on the talk page there are more than two editors in the 'suppress' camp). I complain here about their coordination. Other editors, including  and I simply can't do it any longer. I haven't changed my position on the validity of the article, but I've been accused (on various talk pages, and never the appropriate notice boards) of edit warring, ownership, disruption, and even pedophilia by implication, all for trying to carry out what the community decided. I'm done. I need to limit my time on Wikipedia at present, and wish for that time to be spent pleasantly and productively. When I've made a commitment, though, it grieves me not to keep it. I'm not asking you to do anything: I'm just explaining why I can't keep my word as given at the AfD.

"My experiences came up on the talk page but once I understood Wikipedia I didn't post anything on the article related to my personal experiences. That was like the 2nd day almost two months ago.All of my references are verifiable.There's nothing in the article about my law suit or my being put in jail for engaging in pro se litigation.  I didn't put my experiences in the Judge Edward Nottingham article either although he was my judge.I went out of my way to search for references expressing all the various sides of the issue. For instance, I wrote to the ABA and asked for their input, and in fact, asked them to work on the article. I also posted about issues involved with mediation and settlement with pro ses, citing references from a lawyers point of view.  Those references were deleted by someone, I can't remember who and don't know why. At this point, the only reference that I posted that is soft at all is a blog quoting a transcript quoting a former federal judge and I know for sure that is a valid transcript.  The guy who runs the blog is a 3rd year law student and has a business selling data services exclusively to lawyers.   Even the stuff that was deleted about pro se frustration I had references for. I read in the Wikipedia discussion of sources that blogs can be used in some contexts.I don't believe that I did any original research. All I did is search the Internet for references for the article.  I really didn't know about unbundled attorney services or the amount of pro se litigation before I started working on this article. I had already been thinking about forms based filing but I started thinking about that anyway because of my experiences with ECF, which date back to 2004.  Also, when I was younger I worked as a systems analyst.I did get the info on the Laws and Liberties of MA years ago, but Wikipedia already had an article on that and it probably would have come up anyway.  Same as the U.N. covenantcan't really hide that.   I didn't add a and b together to prove a point, at least not consciously. Like today, I was reviewing appellate procedures and it seemed that the 5th Circuit had a more pro se friendly tone, which I think is because of Judge Learned Hand, who was in the fifth circuit. And the only reason I know about that is that one time I went in every federal circuit and searched on the words ""pro se"" in the 40s because I was trying to see if there was a history of putting pro ses in jail for being pro se (No, there was not).  What I found in the 40s was that some circuits denied all the pro se appeals without even saying why but Judge Learned Hand seemed pro se friendly.I believe that your posting things about pro se litigants getting an unfair advantage is ""soap boxing"". I do understand your wanting to win thru competition though and about law as a business. I've been an entrepreneur. I didn't know about the Federal Judicial Center until I started working on this article. That book on appellate procedure I found looking for references for this article. The manual on complex litigation I found looking for references for this article.Arguing with you helps me to clarify the issues for myself.  One thing I started thinking about a lot in the past few weeks is slavery and how that affected the history of pro se litigation. I ordered the book Slave Nation at the library but I haven't got it yet. But now when I look at pro se law in the different states I think free state, slave state, border state. Also, there were issues related to Indians in some of the western states. The labor union movement had a lot to do with it too, I think. So did the history of workmen's comp, which is of course related to unions.  "	0|0|0|0|0|0

Referring to her as *Catherine* I was told in no uncertain terms that I could NOT refer to anyone, living or dead, by their 1st names on WP, & if a female had a title, she had to be referred to as that throughout her article - ie, *Lady Amy* or *Lady Dudley* for Amy Robsart, even though *Lady Amy* was wrong before she was married as she was the daughter of a knight & had no title, & wrong after Northumberland was attainted & all his children lost their styles as offspring of an earl & a duke, & she did not become *Lady Dudley* until Elizabeth I knighted Robert Dudley near the end of Amy's life nor was she then *Lady Amy Dudley* as legally she was no longer the wife of the son of an earl & duke.  I thought it was simpler to refer to her as just *Amy* throughout rather than explain the changes that occurred with her name & styles, but was told it was against WP *rules* (though I wasn't pointed to a link for it).  Noblewomen are usually called by their 1st names round here as far as I can see, even when they have surnames & are not *of* something!  Mary Boleyn is called *Mary*, not *Lady Carey* or *Lady Stafford*, Catherine Neville is called *Catherine* & not *the Duchess of Norfolk*, etc, & they're not royals.  As for males, I was told they had to be referred to by their title - ie, *Leicester* -  or last name - ie, *Dudley*.  I was banging head on keyboard going, but - no one just says *the king* all the time or refers to them as *Plantagenet* or keeps changing their titles - ie, Henry of Bolingbroke going from Earl of Derby to Duke of Hereford to Duke of Lancaster to King of England -  So how does Kate get to be consistently referred to as *Catherine* throughout the article, without her title appended?  I've only been here a few months & I would appreciate it if someone could actually explain this to me, as my main interest is British history & I am quite confused.	0|0|0|0|0|0

They are all cunts It's not worth editing articles here concerning any serious issue. All sides consist of either people employed to edit or people with very strong opinions that will never, ever change. They advocate their stance as something that is interesting to them instead of using the encyclopedia as a book of knowledge and contributing what they are sure to know.  Soon with the centralization of the net into larger and larger sites, independent information in general will be extinguished. Wikipedia, a project that started by nerds and professionals within their set fields will become the altar of knowledge where depth and true insight is sacrificed for becoming the sound magnifier of yellow press and popular science. The new tool that is intended to auto translate articles from one Wikipedia to an other will extinguish the few national wikipedias that through their niche provide those of multilingual capacity an ability to cross-check facts through other perspectives. With few small, independent sites left, with no or few free university pages left, real knowledge will be the privilege of the few that know how to use academic search engines and have the money to pay for them 78.68.210.173	0|0|0|0|0|0

"Excellent. And please don't damage your book on our account, for sure. It is an interesting question: Where was the camera? That's a fair question. To jump to the conclusion that it was ""impossible"" is ludicrous. But that's typical for the moonbats. The picture is useful for another reason, as it shows a similar relative position of the LEM and the antenna for this Apollo 14 flight as on that web page that argues about those objects in Apollo 12. In both cases, the antenna is at a 45 degree angle away from the LEM, and both the near photo and the distant photo on that website are consistent with each other, despite the website's claims to the contrary. The moonbats isolate on specific items as their ""evidence"", but the more one sees the broader picture, the more their phony arguments get shown up.  "	0|0|0|0|0|0

DECT isn't really a new technology. It's a newer standard, but TDM/TDMA/FDMA digital telephones have been used for a lot longer than the life of DECT. DECT is itself a successor to CT2, Japan's PHS is very similar, and, of course, GSM, D-AMPS, and others have been extensively used across the world for a decade and a half. To suggest there are special health issues with DECT would most definitely be placing undue weight on the subject. DECT is considerably lower power than the analog systems it replaces, both during transmissions, and inherently because even when in use the TD nature of the system means the system isn't transmitting continuously.As I believe I've said before, there is nothing wrong with there being a properly researched article about the health effects of low-power radio technology, and there being a link in the See also: section of this article to it. That article, of course, should look nothing like the section I yanked. There is nothing about DECT however that merits a special section on DECT's dangers, especially when - new technology or otherwise - there is no serious level of concern being expressed by anyone authoritative on this issue.	0|0|0|0|0|0

" Rajputs, not Rajasthanis...right? -P Prof. Hancock's studies mention that the Romani people are most closely related to the Punjabis and Rajputs, I'm pretty sure - not Rajasthanis. He calls Proto-Romani ""Rajputic."" The distinction is important; if they are partly descended from Rajputs, who were never really confined to any one part of India, that would explain the linguistic variation within the Indic words in Romani. For example, why the use of ""-o"" instead of ""-aa"" at the end of masculine nouns/adjectives in Romani? This is certainly a characteristic of Gujarati and Sindhi, but is it a characteristic of Rajasthani languages? Anyway, if I'm wrong in making the last change I made as of now, I'll be happy to revert it myself. Oh, of course,  "	0|0|0|0|0|0

"Words of Encouragement to user ""Damemk"" in the cases of dispute with the users engaged in Bulgarian Nationalistic PropagandaDamemk, You have come to the same conclusions about Bulgarian 19th Century Nationalistic Propaganda on English Wikipedia.User:Laveol is one of the most prominent editors on Wikipedia contributing false information in the articles about Republic of Macedonia, Macedonian Nation|History|Language|Culture|Sports and what else not.He is spending a lot of time working on his cause, pushing Bulgarian Nature in the articles of the domain of Republic of Macedonia.How far has he gone in pushing this propaganda you can see at Wikipedia:WikiProject_ROMacedonia where he has listed himself as a member.So just my few words of concern for the Macedonian Articles in English Wikipedia, and the great damage done by User:Laveol and other users with the Bulgarian and Anti-Macedonian Propaganda.Hopefully with the internet access becoming more affordable to the people in Republic of Macedonia the things will go in right direction: Removing the Bulgarian Propaganda from Macedonian articles, cleaning them of false fabricated information, and giving the facts to the world, and the views of the Macedonian Science and sources.I don't have much time now, but hopefully will be able to find some more in the coming period. I am open to any collaboration|effort for the above goals.I am expecting that this user ""Laveol"" will continue with the Bulgarian Nationalistic Propaganda and polluting the domains in the domain of Republic of Macedonia, simply because he is able to, and can find a ways to continue to work on his agenda.Ours is to try to remove these false claims and contribute the Facts about the Macedonia, Macedonian Nation|History|Lanugage|Culture|Sports.Damemk, I hope you write something here, at least to show that User_talk:Damemk and User_talk:Ejanev is not the same user.    Some insight into my user name EjanevThe only user I am using to contribute to Wikipedia is ""Ejanev"". It is composed of the first letter of my name ""Emil"" and my last name ""Janev"".User ""Damemk"" is a separate user. Probably that user name is comming from ""Dame"" - a Macedonian First name, and ""mk"" or the code of ""Republic of Macedonia"".It does happen that I am from Canada. I was born in Republic of Macedonia and have lived there until I moved to USA first and Canada before more than 3 years.And yes, having all the false information from the Bulgarian Nationalistic Propaganda ( originating from the 19th century ) and having it into 21st century to be used to negate the Macedonian Nation and all it's attributes by users as ""Laveol"", is the reason of some of my editing actions in Wikipedia.I am not the only user/editor from Republic of Macedonia or with Macedonian origin that has the same views for this Bulgarian Nationalistic Propaganda, that already is infiltrated in the Macedonian articles.You can watch the contributions of Special:Contributions/Laveol and see that more than 50% of his actions are engagement in negating the Macedonian Nation and its attributes.

Hence I will save the entire page (minus the archived sections) here. POV concerns Im surprised this article isn't being called anti-semetic, because it's has a *few* traces of Islamic perspectives in it. You know, as opposed to being a piece of Zionist propaganda being passed off as fair and balanced.This entire article is full of baseless jewish propaganda. It is well documented the Banu Qurayza were executed for treason. That is what merited them the death penalty, that they commited treason. The Quarash and other tribes the Muslims fought against were outright enemies who were persecuting them from the start. But the Qurayza signed a peace treaty, then broke it by aiding the enemy. This article contains soo much jewish propaganda that you'd think they were executed for no reason (which no doubt is their aim). Here is a great example. Look at this citation""According to Stillman, Muhammad chose Sa'd ibn Mua'dh so as not to pronounce the judgment himself after the precedents he had set with the Banu Qaynuqa and the Banu Nadir: ""Sa`d took the hint and condemned the adult males to death and the hapless women and children to slavery."" Furthermore, Stillman infers from Abu Lubaba's gesture that Muhammad had decided the fate of the Qurayza even before their surrender.""This author is Norman A Stillman, a Zionist Jew who is very biased. Why is he being used as a quote in an Islamic article? And further more, why is his baseless conjecture allowed to be used, as if it's a fact?There are articles for ""Criticisms of Islam"" where the Jews and others can write whatever they want. But they should have no hand in editing Islamic articles. Because I looked up the Jewish articles and I noticed they dont allow dissent there. You cant put a Muslim perspective on evil acts commited by Jews, without it disappearing instantly. So the same standard MUST be applied to Islamic articles. Islamic articles must be written from the Islamic point of view, and the jews can write their responses in appropriate ""criticisms of Islam"" articles. If not, I will personally edit the Jewish articles and fill them with my conjectures about their history. And I will find a non-Jewish admin to arbitrate over the Islamic articles.Good day.  Please read this talk page, specifically all of the places where ""treason"" or ""traitor"" is mentioned, and if you still believe that we need to mention treason, provide some reliable sources and we can discuss it.  It is easy for our article to be neutral and mention all POVs, but it does require that people like yourself participate.  We work from academic sources, not personal conjecture.   Changes by Devotus and issues with themDear Devotus, I have still issues with your changes:Bat Yeor and Ramadan - while I appreciate that you don't try you shift the balance - removing a book from ""each side"" - I do not agree with your removal. Bat Yeor is an academic scholar and though her books are controversial, she is not beyond the pale - currently she doesn't serve as a reference in the article but if she did, the controversy would be noted. As for Ramadan I have issues with him as well but if we remove him from the literature section, we would have to remove him from the article too, in which he serves as a reference. This is due to the insistence of User:Bless sins. He will certainly not like such a removal. We cannot remove him from the literature section while retaining him in the article.While your first version was needlessly verbose (""it is to be noted that""), the new one endorses that view by Paret/Watt. The article now says that the BQ were not killed for religious reasons - that is not a fact, since there is a good case that the whole conflict was caused by religious differences.Also we do not want to repeat things that have already been said in the coverage of the ""siege and demise"", e.g. the claim about attacking M. in the rear.Also, please abide by the one resolved conflict. We fought hard and long about words like ""massacre"" and ""execution"" and neither should appear unless unavoidable.The common practice thing is unacceptable as it is s	0|0|0|0|0|0

" Mediation Hello, I am Atyndall and I have volunteered to take on your mediation case, during this discussion I will remain neutral with both sides of this argument and will endeavor to solve your dispute. After having a look at the discussion above, this is what I have found:QuizzicalBee has been adding the sentence ""According to Chesler, the the U.S. embassy repeatedly refused to help her leave the country as they no longer recognized her as a U.S. citizen."", Hurmata has been reverting this back to ""She reports that the U.S. embassy repeatedly refused to help her leave the country. Hurmata objects to QuizzicalBee's sentence as he/she thinks that the source is incorrect as the guards would have allowed Chesler into the embassy and first hand accounts from Chesler herself does not qualify as a reliable source. QB objects, saying that maybe in the 1960s US citizenship could have been revoked by the US/Afgan government at that time and perhaps in the past the guards may have denied entry and that her claim should have been presumed true until proven false. Hurmata countered that the citation threat QB was referring to is not the one that was cited. QB states that there is no evidence disproving her claims, so they are valid.Could the involved users please place # ~~~~ below to verify that this statement is correct or suggest why it is not correct?

Well, Arthur, I have printed the paper, and the condition is in fact what Ultra.Power says it is, not your correction. It seems that the paper is not incorrect, but rather correct and pointless.You have already identified the worst problem: The third condition requires incontinuity of f at all integer values. However, this problem disappears if we consider only the special case a=e. So let's do that.We want a function f satisfying f(1)=e and f(n+1)=exp(f(n)), defined as widely as possible. We observe that n=0 and n=1 present no problems: f(0)=1 and f(-1)=0.To extend f to all positive real numbers, it is clearly sufficient to define f on an interval of length 1, such as [0,1).And we want f to be continuously differentiable. (The paper only requires f to be continuously differentiable on (0,1), or equivalently on (-1,0). This is obviously whacky, but we needn't worry about this because a=e.)Next, for no obvious (or explained) reason we require that f ' is monotone on the interval [0,1]. From the functional equation f(x) = ln f(x+1) we get f '(x) = f '(x+1)/f(x+1). Hence f '(-1)=f '(0)/f(0)=f '(0), so f ' must be constant on [0,1]! Not too surprisingly, the function we get in this way is patched together from smaller pieces in a relatively unnatural way: f(x) = exp[x](exp(x-[x])).Thus what I learned from the paper is that the correct solution to the problem probably has a minimum of its derivative between -1 and 0.	0|0|0|0|0|0

Lol, you know what i meant. Whichever president came before Hafez (i just new he was president before assad) has considerable foreground of support, in which his supports would have freaked out because of the coup. They would have claimed instability would arise, as assad's supporters are trying to use in their defense. What i am trying to say is that although Bashar assad had good economic and international policies for Syria, you should not fear a non-baathist potentially being elected.  Syria's economic and international policies won't change (iran would still be a major factor in Syrian life considering the buisness deals stakes and cultural exchanges) , the only this that would change are social freedoms, and for the better. Also every country had a revolution and they are still alive today. The Muslim brotherhood in Syria is weak, even weaker than the islamist prescence in Libya. The rebels in Libya had 80-90% support, as we see now, and yet could hardly take control without NATO. What chance does the Syrian Muslim brotherhood have? None. If anything, nonviolent protests weaken the resolve of the Muslim brotherhood, making them less of an influence in the everyday life of Syrians. As you know I am pro Syria and Armenia, just not pro Assad. Unlike Armenia where people like Sargsyan and Kopcharyan were democratically elected, Assad was not (no one ran against him because they were not allowed).	0|0|0|0|0|0

"{{Unblock|I'll make a renewed effort not to give personal attacks. But of course I do have some questions about this unwarranted blockage, as you might well imagine:1. Why is it that IP editors tend to get the raw ends of the deal: that you ""admins"" tend to lean towards the side of someone who's editing with an account over someone who's editing without one, especially in the area of what you label as ""personal attacks"" or ""harassment"" when given by the IP-editor but not so much when the named editor does the same thing?2. For exampleand this is... yep, maybe you guessed it... question 2: Why is it supposedly ""okay"" (according to you) for someone with a name... like, say... escape orbit... to dish out a personal attack, but not for me to give him one back because I'm just a lowly IP-editor? Specifically, why is it supposedly ""okay"" for him to give me a personal attack by putting false stuff on my keyboard by making the ludicrous claim that my reason for wanting the old style of ""ebaY"" logo to go next to the current one, ""ebay,"" in the lead, is ""because I wanted it in there,"" even though that is a total lie; but it's supposedly ""not okay"" for me to call that kind of slander stupid?3. Here's another one: Why is it supposedly ""okay"" for him and ""smiley girl"" there to falsely accuse my edits of being ""vandalism"" just because they differed from what these guys preferred, but then when I say their reversions are vandalism, I get in trouble for it as if it were a ""personal attack"" just because I'm an IP-only editor?4. Ready for one more? Then why is it fine for any of you named editors to give one of us IP-editors a warning template, but when I, as an IPer do the same thing to a named editor like I did to partially smiley girl, I get dinged with ""Oh, you can't do that 'cause that's a 'personal attack',"" or ""Oh, that's bad because that's 'harassment' ""?5. Oh yeah, here's one more! Remember the rule about edit-warring (just in general, meaning that it doesn't even have to be breaking 3RR) that says that "" 'but I was right, so I was not edit-warring' is no defense""? Well then doesn't that apply to meeting some so-called ""consensus"" too (since some things aren't cases of concrete correctness but are just based more on whether they match what that so-called ""consensus"" wanted the thing to say)? Well then why is it that just because your named friend smiley there does some edit-warring against me to put the thing back to what your exclusive (partial) ""consensus"" wants it to say, AND since my editing had already been established as NOT vandalism even though it disagrees, you ignore that above-mentioned edit-warring rule and give her/him a pass anyway, but when I, an IP-only editor who's against your exclusive ""consensus,"" do the same thing, it's ""edit-warring"" even though it was the same thing as what smiley's doing (remember the ""being-right/matching-consensus-is-no-defense"" rule)?75.162.211.81  "	0|0|0|0|0|0

" Trying to measure the number of cafes This is one of those places where I am so frustrated by Wikipedia's ban on original research. The article has the absurdly low ""at least six cafes on the Ave or its alleys"". I don't know where that number comes from, nor what they consider a ""cafe"", but it seems to me that well within any reasonable definition, the scene includes: Solstice Cafe Zoe The original Allegro (on an alley parallel to the Ave); arguably, its second location in the College Inn also counts The Ugly Mug (half block off) The Cafe at the corner of 42nd that used to be the Roma, but I can't recall its new name Sureshot The Continental Caffe Apassionato WOW Bubble Tea Shinka Tea Company Yunnie Bubble Tea Pochi Tea Gingko Tea House Tully's  Starbucks Wannabee (one block off) Still Life on the Ave (at the Grand Illusion); technically, the entrance is around the corner, but it is clearly effectively on the Ave.This doesn't even count hangouts that are mainly bars or restaurants or takeout food joints, nor does it count things like U.

Bakan Why is Abbie Bakan even mentioned in this article?  Based on the worthless rag of hers which is cited as a source in this article, she's nothing but a shill for Lenin and the rest of the commie gang.  In that rag, she not only shows egregious pro-Communist bias, but doesn't even bother to check the facts, much less look at the causes of the Kronstadt rebellion or even cite reliable historical sources on that subject.  She also discredits herself with absurd accusations of a White conspiracy to overthrow the Soviet government and even of the rebellion being motivated by anti-semitic racism among the sailors.  Furthermore, all the claims made in that rag are based on a case of begging the question: that is, since Lenin's Communist regime was good (major premise) and the Kronstadt rebellion harmed said regime (minor premise), suppressing the rebellion was justified.  Last but not least, the mere fact that the aforementioned rag was first published by a self-admitted socialist party by definition means that this source DOES NOT meet EITHER WP:NPOV OR WP:RS.

You're clearly incapable of appreciating the improvements I made in English, so perhaps you're not the best person to judge. 81.178.252.102	0|0|0|0|0|0
"Speedy deletion of David Fork A tag has been placed on David Fork requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A1 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because it is a very short article providing little or no context to the reader. Please see Wikipedia:Stub for our minimum information standards for short articles. Also please note that articles must be on notable subjects and should provide references to reliable sources that verify their content. If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or ""db"" tag), coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.   what do u want?

"Your suggestion of editing the article is completely workable and was working as per Wikipedia guidelines until Jayjg and SlimVirgin started deleting large relevant chunks of the article, and reverting it to what we have now, as punitive gestures.  If we can all agree to concentrate on making the article better, instead of punishing each other, there is no reason the article has to be locked.I agree that we should start with an extremely innocuous definition preamble statement we can all agree on.  However, a definition doesn't do anyone any good unless it conveys some sort of information.  If there were just one word that we could all agree is associated with terrorism, that would be better than no definition at all: ""intimidate"" for instance.   "	0|0|0|0|0|0
Speaking without knowing what I'm talking about? OK, how 'bout this: the original comment I made about Everlast's entry constantly being vandalized by Eminem fans was written a month ago before your dumb ass got involved with the site. The feud started with the Dilated Peoples track. That's why I believed that the verse Everlast contributed should be in there (and still do). The jabs taken back and forth after that deserve a synopsis only. Your idiotic little comment about album sales was excessive and unnecessary. It belongs in there no more than the fact that everyone who knows both artists agrees that if they ever got into it, Everlast would knock the living shit outta Eminem. And THAT came off an Eminem fan site.	0|0|0|0|0|0

" Bloc voting Countries with large populations of non-nationals may have their televote influenced considerably. This has been cited as the reason for apparent bloc voting in the Balkan countries of the former Yugoslavia.[91] This is full-blown crazy. What does ""non-nationals"" mean? These countries have similar cultures and speak the same languages. The stars in Croatia are popular in Serbia and vice versa. People are nationals of their countries in the largest proportion in each of those countries (there are some refugees in each of those countries, but that doesn't really explain why Croatia would always give the highest no. .of pts to Serbia, or Macedonia to Serbia, where there was no conflict to speak of). For example, I'm a Bosnian Serb and me voting for a Croatian or a Serbian song is not unusual. But I'm not a Bosnian non-national. I have the passport of BiH, and my family has never lived in Serbia in history. It's really about mutual intelligibility  which is why Scandinavian bloc votes for each other all the time.

DI's unverifiable claim which fraudulently spins that into consensual agreement or support for their interpretation or political agenda is not a fact under the rules of Wikipedia.

I don’t know if Nadeau’s experience in Italy qualifies her to make such an assessment, but taking her as a RS to make that statement would be as great an insult to Italian jurisprudence as anything Knox’s supporters have said.

Dunfermline article and new pictures for the Kirkcaldy collage hello again. i've been looking at the paragraph about the Kingsgate Shopping Centre on the economy section. both sources do not indicate that the shopping centre was built in the 1980s nor is there any reference to the centre car park having two levels. me and you know that the centre was built in the 1980s (specifically between 1983 and 1985), if you want make reference to it, use A Century of Dunfermline or Dunfermline: The Post-War Years. but then, i never thought it was that important how old the centre was, anyway. about the two levels on the car park, it is actually three if you've read the sources.also, i think you should reinstate info on the actual size of the extension and where this took place. you might also want to say that the extension was built on the site of the old bus station and car park (info is there on the reference Kingsgate extension on schedule for August 2008 opening by Mivan). as we both probably want to get this article to GA, i would remove all references to the word locate within that section. this is one of many words or phrases that should be avoided if aiming for GA status. that's why when i originally wrote that paragraph on the Kingsgate and other retail areas, i specifically kept the use of the word in question to a minimum. if it isn't dealt with now, it will be at a later date. that aside, i have a new picture of the Beveridge Park which i submitted to Mutt Lucker's home page. (it is now on his talk page if you want to see it) Mutt Lucker thinks it is a good effort and i would like to add it to the collage to replace the picture of the Beveridge Park Pond. as well as this, i have another new picture of the Old Kirk Tower (which was inspired by one on the undiscovered scotland website; the clock has been restored since that pic.) and would like to upload it.	0|0|0|0|0|0

I've done some cleanup, adding a mention of L as the series' main antagonist to the lead. I can't agree that the episode count is insignificant, given that what we're dealing with is how prominent the characters are to the story! More than that, I can't agree that L is absent from the second arc. Yes, he's dead, he's not physically present, but the characters refer to him constantly. His influence pervades the arc, as is shown by numerous quotes and so on. It's like saying Jesus has no relevance to Paul's epistles because he was dead at the time.	0|0|0|0|0|0

Thanks to all for taking my rather offhand comment seriously.  To reiterate my original explanatoin to James: I'm interested in this more on a meta level (how do we approach controversial subjects) than out of deep feelings one way or the other towards Moore and his film; that is, I'm trying to see the forest of making a good article on the film rather than the trees of every factual detail within the film that contributors might have multiple viewpoints about.  For an encyclopedia based around the concept of a Neutral Point of View, any attempt to either counter or defend the content of a subject that is, in itself, an editorial statment seems wrong; such discussions wind up as parasites draining the life and meaning out of an otherwise useful article.  See, for example, something like Roe v. Wade  there's no need to use that article to debate all the pros and cons of the subject involved  there are other articles for that linked at the bottom  just state the facts about the case.  Even if you really consider Moore's movie to be completely indefinsible propaganda (and to risk the Wiki-equivalent of Godwin's Law here), note that the article on Triumph of the Will doesn't feel the need to explain all the reasons why Nazi Germany wasn't all it was cracked up to be.   Similarly, shouldn't we just describe the content of the movie (noting that it is controversial), and then if we want an article about the Bin Laden family departure or whatever we can put the facts about that subject there?   20:19, 5 Jul 2004 (UTC)	0|0|0|0|0|0
But here's the thing history and time travelling (which you did show a citation to), travelling to the earth's centre, creation of the universe, the future, parallel universe, the ultimate fate of the universe, dystopias and utopia (which you did show a citation to), telepathy, intelligence amplification, invisibility, psi powers and psychic phenomenon (as well as the three themes beneath it), resizing, shapeshifting, teleportation, apocalypses or world wide disasters, posthumanism, the ultimate fate of the universe and the kardashev scale, floating cities, underground cities, walking cities, the age of post-scarcity and domed cities can be used in fantasy, there for not exclusive to science fiction. Alien invasions and artificial intelligence (amongst the other themes that are on the page that I can't think of) can be used in horror and are there for not exclusive to science fiction. And as much as I hate to (as we'd be stuffing up the article even more so, but it'd be for it's own good because then after seeing how bad the article's gotten Yobmod wouldn't be so strict about which themes can be used in science fiction) we need to get rid of them immedietally.	0|0|0|0|0|0

"This is untrue.  I have not been blocked for the reasons mentioned but rather for entirely different reasons, since the reasons mentioned are not actually true.  It is impossible to ""exhibit a battleground attitude"" because of many reasons, including the fact that one cannot ""exhibit"" something unless one is a display engineer at a museum, and it would therefore be impossible to ""exhibit"" anything let alone a ""battleground attitude,"" the fact that there is no such thing as a ""battleground attitude,"" the fact that there is no such thing as an ""attitude"" in regards to how a human being acts, and the fact that the word ""exhibit"" is used in an incorrect manner here done solely for the purpose of antagonizing the user (antagonizing me).  Usage of words like ""exhibit"" and ""attitude"", and refusing to follow the section title requirements on my page, show an obvious malfeasance intent by the above person, and therefore the block cannot be valid because within the first sentence he has already seriously demonstrated his lack of appropriate intent by specifically and purposefully being antagonizing.  The second claim is physically possible, but is blatantly false.  I have specifically attempted to PREVENT other users from refusing to communicate in a appropriate manner, as he was repeatedly replying to the same conversation in several different locations, for which I reported him but yet the people at the ALLEGED ""help desk"" refused to tell me where to report him, and even deleted several of my replies and then archived it fraudulently.  Having OTHER USERS delete my comments, participate in blatant fradulent..ism, post the same thing on multiple talk pages at once for the purpose of harassing me, etc., is hardly ""myself making it difficult to communicate,"" when in fact as was just demonstrated I did the LITERAL EXACT OPPOSITE of this by LITERALLY ATTEMPTING TO PREVENT OTHER USERS FROM MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO COMMUNICATE.  ((In addition, if I wish for other users to NOT communicate with me, I also have THAT right, it is in fact specifically written into law in every state in the country and will get you arrested if you fail to do so.  Although I personally disagree with this law and it is an immoral law which deems to prevent for example ex-spouses from communicating with each other when necessary, the part of the law that refers to STRANGERS such as on Wikipedia or anywhere on the Internet, it is a PERSONAL CHOICE whether you wish other strangers on the site to communicate with you or not and/or post contact information etc.  That is why every message board in existence has an option to ""disable the private messaging system"".))There were no personal attacks done by me anywhere, so this part is a baseless and fraudulent claim.""Refusal to abide by the site's guidelines"" is impossible since 1) ""guidelines"" and ""rules"" are two different thing 2) Wikipedia does not have any rules and 3) All policies of any kind are subject to debate and protest at any time according to the numerous Wikipedia articles which specifically say this.You have also demonstrated more incorrect intent by saying that something was ""done in multiple venues,"" even though no venues of any kind exist because this is a website rather then a collection of several different building which show concerts or other entertainment events and/or conventions and/or etc.  So that is also impossible.                       "	0|0|0|0|0|0

Your continual removal and attempt at hiding said removal of specific references on the page that properly attribute the author, title, and publication date of works, in accordance with with standard academic practices and Wikipedia policy, is in fact tendentious.

As you kinow it yourself you are not elligible nor credible nor a reliable source of neutrality in this case as you are yourself a mormon and all you do is to support other mormons, without following any wikipedias rules, but your own churchs solidarity.I dont believe that any of you has even the intention of being straightfo9rward with non mormon or to be a little bit honest, but that the alone thing that activate you is your own religious believe and the pedantisme to think that all you may say or do is auto righteous in the name of the church and all the illusions you dream of with open eyes.I dont want a mormon admi I dont want a mmormon admi I dont want a mormon admi to look into this case but an exterm¨n al one with no relations nor conacts what so ever with this church nor its representants or members.If you cant do that, must be because your circle of admi friends is around the church, or because you know very deeply that all you did was deeply unappropriate and wont stand a micro mile in a wiki trail.I am mad, very mad at you, also because you ignore what I have say, so why should I care about your saying and doing if we have to be neutraly equal?Any idea?I want the text who was deleeted from the archive, it is unacceptable that a text is deleeted from archive and from the edit history, just one hour after it was reverted and less than a day after it was written, without any previous warning of any kind about it.This is all about wiki rules and you have broken them all.	0|0|0|0|0|0

The article needed expansion somehow. The Vales case, which caused a huge public outcry and about which tens and tens of newspaper articles and thousands of talkbacks were written, is definitely noteworthy. If it does not belong here, it should get its own article. I propose leaving it here and adding other materials also. And it is not a negative thing, it is completely positive. I, for one, think the Edah was much too lax. The protests should have been much stronger. Call me a kanoi, I guess I am. Please add more information instead of removing the information present. The article needs to be expanded somehow. It's shameful that we only have so little information on it here.  | (talk)	0|0|0|0|0|0

" July 2006 (UTC)Well, yes, that's fine, but the point here is that there is no publisher's statement made about anything in that sentence. The idea behind having a resource is that we copy what the resource says instead of just listing them as a reference. If the resource says, ""Joe at worms"" then we write ""Joe ate worms"". About tarnishing any reputation, that isn't the point at all. And about accepted practices in the publishing world, this is Wikipedia and the accepted practices are covered by what we call ""policy and ""guidelines"" since those came about over a long period of time and through the process of consensus. About people keeping records of how many books were published, I think you missed the point there. Publisher's Weekly magazine has a statement about the number of books among other things for example. They are a secondary source. Do you see how that's different?  About the article on FIP, it hadn't any sources at all which is one of the reasons it was deleted. The only references which it had on the bottom were ""See Also"" references that pointed to this article here, and other articles which were also unsourced except for pointing to this article here. FIP and ACIM.ORG are the same entity. FACIM is also the same entity. This is known.

The Beta Adrenergic Theory is the ONLY Theory of Asthma that can be associated with one name {not including crackpots} so your question about other names insults my intelligence!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Not only that but in contrast to other theories this one has been cited more than any other article in the history of the Journal of Allergy according to the GARFIELED LIBRARY at The University of Pennsylvania. Last but not least, my comment would be out of place in the history section because it relates DIRECTLY to the BA2 polymorphism.

Having worked in an intellectual property firm for a few years, and now as a student in law school, I am convinced from what I know of the law that this clip does not infringe upon any rights of the film, and any infringement that has occurred thus far from it has been attended to by the ABC news team for the release of their story. So, please, can we try to negotiate or come to some sort of agreement that it will be okay to leave this clip up? I'm new to wiki-editing, but believe this clip would make a nice addition to the Spider-Man 3 site. I'm sure lots of fans would find it funny and interesting, to say the least.

The multitude of sources simply cannot be ignored. There are several articles stating the environmental impact.

" Can someone explain criticism #6 to me? This is taken from the criticisms section of the article:6. Since logic is inherently constant, and that some things are more true than others, it means that ""strong"" relativism cannot hold true under many conditions. Relativism often ignores how views have different weight to another. An example of a similar phenomenon is the Gay Marriage debate in the U.S. - an example where the majority dictates the rights of the entirety even when it doesn't apply to them, as they do not weigh up the effects of their views. Can someone explain what exactly this means? I do not follow the first half of the paragraph (the one that actually pertains to relativism), and the example reads as complete nonsense to me, especially this part:""...the majority dictates the rights of the entirety even when it doesn't apply to them, as they do not weigh up the effects of their views.""I do not think that:a) The majority in question believes that ""it"" doesn't apply to them. (Though I'm not sure what ""it"" is in this context, so the sentence may be true.) The majority believes that allowing gay marriage would undermine the moral standards of their society, which, of course, applies to everybody in that society.b) The majority in question does not ""weigh up the effects of its views"". Its views are that gay marriage should not be allowed, for the benefit of society; it is aware of the effects; and does not object to them.  "	0|0|0|0|0|0

And PaganismSouthgate, who has a degree in theology and religious studies from Canterbury University, rejected Catholicism and moved towards neo-pagan and heathen groups that are ‘very loyal to the Gods of the Northern Tradition’, including the Odinic Rite, the Tribe of the Wulfings and the A ´ satru´ Alliance, a pagan movement concerned with practising rituals and magic and led by Valguard (Mike) Murray, a former member of the American Nazi Party.91 Further evidence of this transition from Catholicism to paganism emerged in an interview with Wotan, the organ of the Charlemagne Hammer Skins.92 Southgate believed that Wotan’s celebration of the heroes of the Norse pantheon represented ‘the most genuine expression of European spirituality, culture and identity’.93 Another key expression of this ‘identity’ is exhibited by Southgate’s interest in the militaristic cult of Mithras and the ‘pagan spirituality’ of the apostate Roman emperor Julian II.94This rejection of Christianity has an avowedly antisemitic dimension. Through the figure of Christ, Christianity has Judaic roots and is therefore irredeemably tainted; only the ‘weak’ continue to worship a ‘dead Jew’.95 The emphasis on the Judaic roots of Christianity, however, is regarded as of secondary importance to its usurpation of the rituals, sacraments and hierarchy of the ancient pagan solar religion Mithras, which was introduced into Iran and India by marauding Aryan tribes from the Russian steppes between BCE 2000 and 1500 before spreading to the Roman empire. Although it failed to defeat early Christianity in the battle for religious supremacy during the fourth century, Mithras continues to be viewed by esoteric thinkers (including Evola and Jung) as an alternative path the West could have followed. It retains its appeal as an initiatory cult or aristocratic order akin to the Knights Templar or, latterly, Himmler’s SS which, the NRF claims, had its origins in various ‘Anarchist droite ’ circles l e the Black Sun and the Thule Society. While Christianity tried to neuter this vital expression of the ‘Aryan psyche’, the awareness of Europe’s ‘Faustian’ destiny is currently enjoying a renaissance within the occult milieu. These ideas were also absorbed by thinkers like Evola and Rene´ Gue´non who discerned in them the fragments of a ‘hidden albeit distinct and fundamental truth’.96 For Southgate, as for Evola, Tradition is an ‘an underlying current which both permeates and transcends all’.97Southgate’s discovery of Evolian ‘Primordial Tradition’ and his consequent rejection of Catholicism as ‘the sole cosmological truth’ ran in tandem with his immersion in the industrial music scene.98 This ‘cultural vanguard’ is spearheaded by a number of Gothic-Industrial, Dark Ambient, Black and ‘Viking’ Metal bands, including Allerseelen, Blood Axis, Burzum, Current 93, Dark Holler, Death in June, Endura, Mayhem, Ostara, Puissance and Sol Invictus, though it also encompasses more commercial bands like Cradle of Filth.99 Although it would be an exaggeration to say that these groups conform to a defined political agenda, their music serves to diffuse the ideals of Mithraic paganism and Nordic folk myths within this youthful underground subculture far more effectively than any number of meetings and marches could, thus providing the ‘perfect antidote’ to the spiritually enervating, multiracial values of a globalizing ‘system’. Southgate has also noted the potential of the Straight Edge punk movement and its hard core of puritanically intolerant followers, an interesting development given (exaggerated) reports of an emerging ‘anti-anti-establishment’ pro-Bush right-wing punk movement.100 Although Southgate realizes that the groupuscular right cannot control music-orientated youth cultures, he believes a minority can be induced ‘to take a direction basically conducive to our aims’.101 Southgate seeks to do this through his online magazine Synthesis, which features a music section replete with interviews and gig reviews.102This is not simply cynical manipulation. Southgate appears genuinely interested in the counter culture he seeks to target. His fanzine, Tribal Resonance, ‘the voice of the racial avant-garde’, reveals Southgate’s strategy of linking his ideas to ‘the common language and the big ideas of our culture’.103 Through the medium of musical subcultures and the creation of alternatives ‘from without’, Southgate hopes to permeate existing political subcultures transversally, as the Nazis did, through a process of ‘cultural osmosis’ that aims to recode the ‘social symbology’ of the host culture so that its ideas can metastasize throughout the body politic, recalibrating its genetic inheritance. By creating ‘cultural hegemony’ the groupuscular right believes it can forge the ‘political space’ necessary for political and racial hegemony.104The struggle for cultural heg	0|0|0|0|0|0

Addition of history As can be seen, I have added a new history section for the Bank of Liverpool - previously there were just a few lines of intro. I have taken it up to 1918, when the Bank acquired Martins Bank and became the Bank of Liverpool and Martins. There already is separate article on Martins which makes reference to the Bank of Liverpool but it is not well sourced and could be made more comprehensive.I propose continuing the Bank of Liverpool history to 1928, when the name was shortened to Martins, and possibly beyond.How should the overlap with the Martins Bank article be treated? The name change to Martins is really a red herring - it is the Liverpool entity which was dominant and provided the continuity until its acquisition by Barclays and therefore I suggest should be the main article. One solution would be to have Martins pre-1918 history as a self-contained article with the Bank of Liverpool article continuing up to 1969.	0|0|0|0|0|0
"OK, I'll try to sort through your latest post here. Let me know if I misinterpret something.First, you specify a theory (axiomatic system), namely ZFC-P+""P(P(omega)) exists"". Let's call that T0 for easy reference.Now you argue that T0 proves the existence of a model (let's call it M1  the 1 because it's not a model of T0, but of a new theory), such that:M1 satisfies ZFC-PP(omega) is in M1. Now, do you mean the real P(omega), or do you mean that M1 satisfies ""P(omega) exists""  that is, that there's an element of M1 that M1 thinks is P(omega)?  I'm guessing the latter  that M1 satisfies ""P(omega) exists"".You say ""aleph2 is in the model and is less than or equal to [the cardinality of] P(omega)"". Again I'm guessing you mean that this is in the model's opinion; that is, M1 satisfies the statement "" exists and |"".OK, so going with my guesses thus far, I agree that T0 proves the existence of such an M1. M1 might be, for example, M0[G], where M0 equals  (which is a model for T0), and G is M0-generic for the partial order to add  Cohen reals."	0|0|0|0|0|0

"Justin Vaisse's opinionThis relative absence of French-American political and social unity helps to explain anti-French sentiment in the United States. French historian Justin Vaïsse has proposed that an important cause of overtly expressed public hostility toward France in the United States is the small number of Americans of direct French descent1. http://www.politiqueinternationale.com/revue/article.php?id_revue=12&id;=228&content;=synopsis. While he acknowledges that this is not the direct cause of anti-French sentiments, he argues that it explains why these sentiments can be expressed publicly, without being seen as a gross violation of political correctness. Vaïsse contends that by comparison, the public display of such sentiments towards other ethnic groups or nationalities would be met by strong disapproval. He proposes that as France has no powerful and organised lobby to defend it, it is socially and politically acceptable in the United States to express negative sentiments of the FrenchPierre Verdaguer, ""A Turn-of-the-Century Honeymoon? The Washington Post's Coverage of France"", French Politics, Culture & Society, vol. 21, no. 2, summer 2003. Just to answer, I've read before that the proportion of french descendant in the US is way higher than thought because as the french colonized the New World at the same time as the Brits but got outnumbered pretty quickly, they were mixed into the mainstream america. However it's true that since most of them lost traces of their heritage no lobby exists nor defends them as they don't represent or try to represent.  "	0|0|0|0|0|0

"==Proposed move to Stiffness to weight ratio==Why is this article named with the least commonly used term for this property?  Google returns 75,400 results for ""specific modulus"", 78,700 results for ""specific stiffness"", and 783,000 results for ""stiffness to weight ratio"".I could understand this if Wikipedia were advocating the term ""specific modulus"", e.g. because it is shorter, or more technical sounding, or whatever.  However my understanding was that Wikipedia was explicitly not in the advocacy business and that its articles should be named with the commonest term.  In this case the commonest term occurs ten times as often as the other two terms.This name has the further benefit of being self-explanatory, whereas those unfamiliar with either of the other two names would have to consult a dictionary when they encounter it in a text, which may well be why it is by far the commonest term.I therefore propose moving this article to Stiffness to weight ratio and linking the other two terms to it.  This won't compromise findability in any way, but the choice of name will indicate the most commonly used term.    "	0|0|0|0|0|0
" Why ""Commonwealth"" instead of ""Dominion?"" Based upon comparing the governments of the Dominion of Canada and the Commonwealth of Australia, I don't really understand the differences.  The idea of a Commonwealth seems to compare directly with that of a Republic, so if the Queen of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is the Queen of Australia, how can one style Australia a Commonwealth?  Would it not be a Dominion as is the case for Canada?  And would not the States of Australia likewise be provinces?  I honestly don't understand the differences between each of these and if someone could explain them to me, it would be greatly appreciated.   2 July 2005 03:19 (UTC)"	0|0|0|0|0|0

", which originally appeared in the London Independent on August 13, 2002, is, I think, excellent in both sensitively disputing the official account of Flight 93 and highlighting the US media's reluctance to do so. I am unaware if the titular questions have been answered in the past three years, or whether the journalist's sources have since been discredited; Cberlet, as you seem confident that they have been, do please provide proof!  Please note though, my point is NOT that this article should be rewritten to claim that the flight was shot down, or even that the possibility should be mentioned; simply that inserting ""The 9/11 commission determined that"" would make this article more objective in places.

Legally, there are no rules which state any geographical or political requirements which a state has to meet in order to join the Schengen area (there are such criteria for joining the EU, but this is a different matter). The only possibility to join the Schengen zone would be to enter into a treaty with the EU, which includes a clause that Schengen-related EU law would be applicable in the associated non-EU state. The associated state would only have the right to be consulted. Thus, the U.S. would have to accept each and every majority (!) decision taken in Brussels whether citizens of this or that country would need a visa for entry into the area or not. And the U.S. would have to accept that every third-country national holding a residence title of a Schengen state could enter the U.S. without even being checked. To BIL: Guadeloupe and French Guiana are not inside the Schengen area because this would e.g. require France to equip the complete rain forest border between French Guiana and Suriname, Brasil etc. with high-tech infrared sensors which would detect every monkey which is crossing the border - just in order to avoid ID checks on flights between there and Europe. I can understand why they do not invest any money into this.	0|0|0|0|0|0

"No. It does not. The infobox clearly says they are gone. But this discussion is old: Every now and then someone says ""if we write X, someone might assume Y"". The consensus is: We can't hold ourselves responsible for what people wrongly assume out of their own volition. If we write X, someone might also assume W and Z too. We can further clarify in the article body but turning this infobox into a copy of the infobox on Internet Explore 11 article, or whatever comes last, surely isn't the way to go.Still, if you are not convinced, you can proceed with WP:DR.

" Silesians Andrew, I have not made any comments out of a desire to provoke you. I have been editing this article out of a desire to ensure it meets the standards and conventions of the English Wikipedia. I am sorry you had a negative experience with the German Wikipedia, but that is a separate project from this English project. Assuming good faith is a fundamental principle of the English Wikipedia; I advise you to give editors a chance instead of assuming the worst. I inquired about Silesian/Polish because Silesians are sometimes considered a separate ethnic group. I am not sure what you mean by ""reverting the article upside down""; my editing has been done to ensure that its formatting and style is consistent with other biographical articles. As I do not anticipate being able to copy-edit the article further, I am removing it from my watchlist. Good luck with the article. Olessi  Thanks for you comments, and in fact fruitful discussion. You are right that the work of a person is most important.However, there are much present and past propaganda, which destroy the peace. If only some people would show objectivity and patience, as you did, it could be clear up. To mention nationality is however important, since exceptional individuals inspire new generation of a nation. (Unfortunately, nations or ethnic groups will still exist. I have to hope for peaceful coexistence of them, and fair competition. Seems to me that competition has to exit too – best if for fun only.)I am conscious that English and German Wikipedias are separate projects, but you see, when I approach German Wiki, Dzierzon article the Polish relevant article was attacked by some German/Silesian/Polish guy. It cost me more then here on En Wiki to settle the Pl article well. So sorry if you did feel bad about my attitude, possibly I explained more my excitement.With Silesian is in short like this: Originally, they were Slavic tribe, spoke Polish, as I mentioned. For some 300 to 500 hundred years there were under German governments. They had bad time as you possibly can imagine. Many of them married with German and were/are of course confused who they are. You know, the pressure on east of resilient nation and of course Polish-German conflicts continued. Finally in 1945 Poland returned and become new problem for some of the natives. Even those who honestly considered himself Polish Silesians at the end of war could be persecuted. There in Poland was complete disorder. Soviets and Communists arrived, most of them real simpletons any way. “National” government - just pro-soviet mafia, was mostly occupied with fight against democratic opposition. Polish borders were shifted. We lost some 20% of our area and millions of people from east territories moved to present west Poland. You can imagine that most of them were not intellectuals at all, some of them completely simple people. They spoke different Polish dialect also. On top of this in the post war, pro-soviet atmosphere criminals found good playground. Well, I do not know if you are familiar with criminal minds – unfortunately I am. This is like gangrene on fresh wound, literally. Thus many of the native Silesian could be robber in Poland, which they wanted so much. I believe that in such conditions many simpletons could use the opportunity accusing natives to be Germans.Now, the present time, some of the falsely accused people remember the tragic experiences and want rehabilitation and apology – they could be absolutely right. However, there are many Germans who want their property back and some just using opportunity to stir in internal Polish affairs - despite the final border agreement between Poland and Germany signed on 14 November 1990 and governments effort to improve relations.Finaly I have to say, I beleave that Polish are hospitable and very often naïve. Not many realize that politic need caution. Those who realize that have a hard time to wake up the naïves. Some procentage remember lectures of history, and objectively, too many Germans are toublemakers. I am also convinced there exists something like national character. You can have obviously you own opinion, let me have my own.Returning to Silesians it is something close to squaring the circle . I wish the true Silesian all the best but I do not want Fith Column  on Polish terytory in addition.Sorry if I used posibly ofencive ""reverting the article upside down"" that was in the heat of the battle, wich I still have with Ge Wiki. They just arogantly do not answer if they do not like and refuse mediatior at any imaginative pretext. That sucks.Sorry and thanks again. Feel free to contact me any time you need.Best regards, Andrew 02:23, 9 December	0|0|0|0|0|0

banging your head against a wall Hi, I see JayJG has been leaving messages on your page, with his false concern about the rules and supposed reasonableness.  In reality, JayJG is a rabid Zionist and is trying to purge Wikipedia of any negative information about Zionism, and is trying to paint Muslims in a bad light.  Along with many of his cohorts.The problem is that JayJG is part of the Wikipedia cabal.  When there were elections, despite massive efforts to the contrary, a number of people got a higher vote percentage than JayJG - but Jimbo Wales put him on ArbCom anyhow.  Jimbo has shown his true colors as well.These people control Wikipedia.  They are all together, and attacking you.  No one is coming to your aid.  This is because they control Wikipedia, with Jimbo at the center, and have more or less driven off everyone else.  You are banging your head against a wall here - any massacre by Zionists against Palestinians will be covered up, disorted, justified etc., anyone who attacks an Israeli soldier will be castigated here.My suggestion is to direct your efforts to somewhere more creative, like a wiki encyclopedia that is not pro-Zionist and anti-Muslim like this one.  Or if you do continue here for a little bit, to spend less time.  It is better to waste 5 hours of time accomplishing nothing than 10.  Eventually you will give up here, everyone does.  You are fighting a losing battle.	0|0|0|0|0|0

Not tactics. You create a page about a non-existant subsiduary, change all the links and then complain when things don't go your way. You created the chaos and then demand that others fix the problem that YOU created. You stuffed it - YOU fix it. Pretty simple in my book. Things were pretty good until you invented the BMW Motorrad subsiduary and changed everything. Now that it has been shown that you were wrong you blame everyone else for the chaos caused by your arrogance. Maybe returning things to how they were before you broke it would be a good idea. Oh! An apology would also be good!	0|0|0|0|0|0

To Father Tanner, thank you for bringing some sanity to this article.  After having read the latest version, I must say that it very well balanced...considering some of the horrible slanting that it experienced for a while there.  I would think that protecting the page is a good idea, even if it means my newly created account won't work, that is, if the tone remains such as it is presently.  On Fish Campmore's blog, I have read through much of it.  Mostly, it is complete trash.  The rest of it shows very poor scholarship at best.  The threads on it during July were very shrill and completely out of line.  I would not like to see it linked for those very reasons.  CECFAN 30 August 2006	0|0|0|0|0|0

Current Events StoryHi, I removed the story you posted on Cuurent Events for several reasons: The story didn't seem to belong on the date where you placed it. If the story was reported in a newspaper dated January 13th, it shouldn't be listed under the January 20th events. I know this may be an important story in Belize, but (as far as I can tell) only one newspaper is carrying it and there are no hits on Google News. It doesn't appear to be of global importance, which is usually what it takes to be included on Current Events. The summary was way too long. Two or three sentences is usually the maximum for a summary. If it wasn't for the first two points, I would have attempted to edit the summary instead of deleting. For now, I'm going to remove the story, but if you can find more sources, please feel free to include a short summary and link on the correct date.  18:44, 20 Jan 2005 (UTC)	0|0|0|0|0|0

First of all, there's no need at all to apologise about discussing your dispute here. Secondly, I think it would be a good idea (or actually an essential step in solving the dispute) to back off from this for a few days, maybe even a week. As you've been back-and-forthing for months already, another week can't possibly hurt. You'll find that walking away and editing some articles unconnected with farming or with animal welfare will help put this whole hill of beans into its true perspective. It will give us time to find other, better (or at least more widely acceptable) images to use.

. According to TV (History Channel?  NOVA?) the stove impacts us little today, and is not important.  The stove is difficult to make work correctly.  The complicated flue will back smoke into the room if not operated just right.  As a result, the design was never popular, even in Franklin's time, and quickly fell into disuse.  I dunno if there's a connection between the Franklin Stove and box-shaped fire boxes used today.  I don't recall any mention of the fact on the TV special.	0|0|0|0|0|0

The exceptions are::Image:Wankhede Mumbai.jpg - On the flickr page the author has apparently agreed to license the image under one of the free Creative Commons licenses, but failed to actually change the licensing. :Image:Dhoom2.jpg - Concern that the creator is in no position to submit the image under a Creative Commons license, as it depicts a billboard for a film and copyright to it is held by somebody else than the photographer. As such, the photo may not be used on Wikipedia, except perhaps under fair use policy (which probably doesn't apply), or under panorama freedom (depending on what the copyright law of India says on this topic).:Image:Bipasha.jpg - Image description page implies that it is licensed for non-commercial use only (contradicting your copyright tag); such a restriction is not acceptable on Wikipedia.

There are multiple Creative Commons licenses, not all of which are acceptable on Wikipedia. In particular, licenses that prohibit commercial use or making of derivative works are considered unfree and can't be used on Wikipedia, except as provided by the fair use policy; Creative Commons Atrribution, and Creative Commons Atrribution Sharealike licenses are okay. Also, there are multiple versions of the licenses; Creative Commons Atrribution Sharealike 1.0, 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0 are all distinct licenses. (The problem is that the upload dialogue only lists the 3.0 versions and not the earlier ones; when the image is under one of the older licenses, you ought to edit the image description page and correct the number. As far as I can see, Flickr only uses the 2.0 versions of the licenses.)In addition, some of the Flickr authors have indicated that they allow the image to be used on Wikipedia, without making it clear that they release it under one of the acceptable licenses; a permission that only extends to Wikipedia is not sufficient, either. You should ask the authors to do one of the following:Change the Flickr page to license the image under Creative Commons Attribution (or Attribution Sharealike) license (apparently, this would change the licensing for all images, and this may not be what they intend to do);Post a message to the image page with a text similar to the following:I, creator of the image, agree to license it under the Creative Commons Attribution license (link) [alternately: under the Creative Commons Attribution Sharealike license (link). This declaration overrides any statement to the contrary on this page.E-mail the Wikimedia Foundation (permissions-en[AT]wikimedia[DOT]org) with a message similar to the above, also specifying which image (images) the user intends to release under the license.

" Israeli-Palestinian conflict protect? Yesterday there were relevent and reliably-sourced casualty figures added to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict article, and some editors objected to this. It seems you were called in to quickly ""protect"" the page from editing, effectively blocking the inclusion of the figures. You cited ""edit warring,"" the more accurate term would be repeated reverts from those who did not like the figures for political reasons. There are casualty figures in all the conflict, war, battle etc. Wiki articles I have referenced, why not this one? Thanks   RomaC, the edits which you tried to make were a set of statistics for one year only, which you attemepted to place in the first paragraph of an article describing a conflict of over sixty years. This article covers an issue of extreme sensitivity and complexity. The fact that your edits sparked so much conflict and opposition speaks for itself. Here at Wikipedia, we value the ability to achieve consensus, and to be fair to many viewpoints. And believe it or not, we often do achieve that at the article Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It is not enough to disinegnuously claim that your figures were ""reliable,"" without addressing any of the underlying issues, or any of the conflicts which it clearly and immediately caused. To repeat: statistics for just one year of the conflict do not belong anywhere in the article's lead. there are a wide variety of figures which either side could quote, all in the name of objectivity, which would clear and unacceptably attempt to create a slant towards one side or the other. please note, this is why we are careful when making edit to be sure that we actually have consensus, rather than simply telling others that they should provide consensus.   I strongly object to your calling me ""disinegnuous"" [sic]. You wrote on the article talk page that you agreed with Hertz1888, who argued that the statistics might be biased. Do you not regard Haaretz as a reliable source? Please explain more clearly why you feel that citing reliably-sourced and up-to-date civilian casualty statistics in an article about a war, battle or conflict is disingenuous. If you or any other editor want to add more statistics, covering a longer time period, then go ahead, but do not delete relevant content added by other editors. Yes, the edit ""sparked so much conflict and opposition"" but note also also that here at Wikipedia we do not determine what is ""fair"" through intimidation by numbers. There is a big difference between consensus and false compromise.   I apologize if you felt I was offending you in any way. i only meant to describe the appearance of your edits, not to describe you personally in any way. if other editors deleted some edits, it is because they genuinely felt there was a reason to do so, and that the material was not beneficial or fair to the article. I responded to your concerns and issues further at the article talk page. thanks.    Apology accepted, and I will also make my further comments on the article talk page. I am not a single-issue editor I get around a bit on Wiki, saw the Haaretz report and very much believe it is something very relevant to the article. I can't say I know for certain why other editors deleted the material, I try to assume good faith, we'll see.   ""repeated reverts from those who did not like the figures for political reasons"" - motive doesn't really matter, its still edit warring, its still disruptive. Protection is not an endorsement of the current version. Z-man The subject of this article is a deadly conflict, the lede is huge - and yet it contains no mention of the casualties. Clearly, there is something seriously wrong. As a result, your action here, while well-intentioned, looks highly partisan. Worse than that, it looks rather like like a cynical move to protect deniers, those who wish to cover up atrocities, the mass killings of (mostly) unarmed civilians, in many cases recognised by Western sources as war-crimes. If the events at this article really offend you, it would be a lot better to lock it at the alternative version. talk 10:39,	0|0|0|0|0|0

No matter how many times I rethink it I cannot come to the conclusion that a creamery is a goddamn cheese. Categories sre for things of the same type and a category for Northern Irish cheeses should contain articles about Northern Irish cheeses, not about cheese farms or cheese factories or cheese shops or people who make cheese. How is this possibly open to interpretation? Creameries are not cheese.	0|0|0|0|0|0

"How did you decide that bukkake always implies a female subject? Also, just because a word has a historical meaning doesn't mean that it can't ever mean anything else as culture develops. The word rap meant ""to knock, as on a door"" up until the late 70s for example. Would you deny the more modern use of the term? The English language has no board to regulate it, as French does with the L'Académie française, so you have no basis for defining what the word means. We have groups and documents that define the proper use of words like ""you're"" and ""your"", for example, but none such for words like bukkake. If it can be shown that it is used in a particular way, that is valid. My personal belief is that there is no need for the qualifier ""gay"", just as there is no need to call men having anal sex ""gay anal sex"", but that's really irrelevent. I think it is important to make clear the historical implications, but not to deny that we are currently creating and modifying language. Even the fact that we have taken the word bukkake, ""splash"", from Japan and created this very specific connotation of splashing not just anything, but specifically semen and specifically onto a person's face shows that this term is elastic and subject not to rules that we impose on it, but by the meaning that it has to the people who use it.

" Crimea/Ukraine articles Hi HJ. In the message you left on my talk page (here), you explained your reasoning for not protecting the relevant articles. As my response there indicates I don't share your opinion, but I understand where you're coming from. In that comment you also said ""I'd really like to avoid protecting them for the duration if that can be avoided, but if you keep bringing issues to my attention, I'll do my utmost to make your life easier"". So this is the ""bring the issues to your attention"" on my part. See this 3RR request  filed by User:Kudzu1. It's sort of gone past ""lots of disruptive anon IPs"" causing trouble on these pages, to pretty much full blown sock puppetry and abuse of multiple accounts by at least - though likely, more - one person. So. How can my life be made easier? SPI? I already filed one, on one sock master  (though that's probably a different person) and some other users have filed others (for example ). The problem is - and notice that a CU has not even gotten around to the SPI I filed - that by the time the CUs get around to considering these cases, the person(s) behind these accounts have already thrown them away and moved onto new SPAs which keep doing the same thing. Not sure what the best course of action here is but it's helluva frustrating trying to deal with this.  "	0|0|0|0|0|0

I already created  ID (occasionally forget to log in but you can see the same class C when I do) I collected a massive number of diff edits on Balkanfever who pretends to be neutral but is  on record] getting blocked for saying this about Greeks under a previous handle. (not to mention his personal talk page is one big anti-Greek rant fest pointing to questionable FYROM news sources with highly exaggerated sensationalist titles)""No, Assfuckers (has a nice ring to it D) use it as a pejorative term. I was ready to pull the trigger on both him, admin Futper, and a few others (e.g. Macedoniaboy who says he is a ""proud fighter for united Macedonia on his talk page) with a detailed complaint about anti-Greek propaganda but since Futper managed a civil discussion with me and now seems to be sticking to debating articles (rather than threats of blocking)  I'm going to avoid escalating this further for now. ns. As for the current naming disputing article... I agree with you that some FYROM citizens honestly believe their claims but I don't think that reduces the existential threat to Greece. Communism fell 17 years ago in Yugoslavia and the FYROM government appears to be getting worse not better (imagine if in two hundred years they call themselves ""ethnic Athenians"" and the cycle continues until their is no Greece left). There appear to be important quotes missing from the naming dispute article that clearly demonstrate that FYROM leadership are confused about their own national identity (and confusing their own citizens in the process unfortunately). I tried to add this to the talk page of the article but Futper deleted it (arguing ancient Macedon is unrelated to the article even though his own editing history shows him adding an edit arguing that ancient Macedon wasn't Greek) I didn't want to get into a revert war over simply a discussion of perceived facts but since I didn't think those facts should be censored either I thought perhaps you could add them to discussion on the naming dispute talk page. (assuming you see it as relevant yourself of course)February 26, 1992: The FYROM's President Kirov Gligorov, at an interview by the Foreign Information Service daily report, Easten Europe, stated: '""We are Slavs, who came to the region in the sixth century. We are not descendants of the ancient Macedonians.'""January 22, 1999: The FYROM's Ambassador in Washington D.C., Mrs. Ljubica Acevska, gave a speech on the present situation in the Balkans, she stated: '""We do not claim to be descendants of Alexander the Great. We are Slavs and we speak a Slavic language. Greece is The FYROM's second largest trading partner and its number one ""investor.""'February 24, 1999: The FYROM.'s Ambassador to Canada, Gyordan Veselinov, in an interview with the ""Ottawa Citizen"", he admitted: '""We are not related to the northern Greeks who produced leaders like Philip and Alexander the Great. We are Slavs and our language is closely related to Bulgarian. There is some confusion about our identity.""'I think the above needs to be compared to that of their current hard line prime minister's recent behavior. He directly contradicts FYROM's own government's previous comments about themselves (that apparently was unauthentically meant to assure foreigners that Greeks were imagining FYROM propaganda and to reduce the issue to a childish dispute over simply names.. in order to get recognition)Prime Minister Gruevski officially meets Prince Ghazanfar of Pakistan] who claims to be related to Alexander the Great.. then uses it as an opportunity to suggest FYROM citizens are related to ancient Macedonians.

Articles Ive just deleted The Bug3r3r Team (or however that was spelled), and notice 2 other deletion requests on other articles here. I also read your note on that article's talk page, and think you may be misunderstanding the purpose of Wikipedia. We only allow articles on subjects that are notable; generally, this means that they have been discussed in detail in multiple, independent reliable sources. That means that a company that's just recently started, that has never produced a product, and that, by the way those were written, seem closer to a group of friends, is not a suitable subject for a WP article. Basically, if you can't find a number of newspaper (etc.) articles discussing the company, it shouldn't have an article. I hope this explains why these articles were deleted.In connection to this, I need to ask you to stop creating articles on businesses of this type. Continuing to do so adds extra work for other editors and administrators, and these are clearly non-notable companies (so much so that we used the expedited Speedy Deletion Process).	0|0|0|0|0|0

"(outdent) How about looking at it like this. RPG rulebooks are just that. The rulebook explains how to play the game, but it is not the game itself. The ISBN manual you reference below supports this; games ""SHALL NOT"" be given ISBNs. There may be some confusion in the matter, but one good example is found by harking back to AD&D; 2nd Ed. To play that game required (it being rules heavy, that really is pretty much true) a minimum of two books—the DM Guide and the Players' Handbook. Neither ""contained"" the game, and the game went far beyond what was in either. The game in all its entirety encompassed the contents of many books, magazine articles, supplements, pamphlets, online articles and what was in the head of the players. The book is about the game; it is not the game.  For that matter, a number of the articles you tagged did not list an ISBN, so you can't really claim that you claimed it was a book in ignorance because of the ISBN. A publisher doesn't mean it's a book, as board games, computer games, and any number of things are published and have publishers.  "	0|0|0|0|0|0

So your poor judgment is not in doubt. Your following days of rant showed your true reason for not wanting the link, it was because you didn’t like the idea of the site also selling hotel rooms. The link to the visitor centre is still there by the way, which shows it was regarded as being a legitimate item to link to.

Clifford Algebra Hi, I have't forgotten that you wanted to discuss a bit further. I'd like that too. I'm on sort of a semi-Wiki-break right now, but, in the meanwhile, could you elaborate onBy the way, I'm interested in seeing (if you have an example in mind) an illustrative example of leveraging basis elements of a complex space that square to -1. That sounds like an interesting benefit that might normally be passed over in pure math texts.a bit. I'm not sure exactly what you mean, and there might be no mathematical significance, but there is surely physical significance to be extracted. The complexification is made partly for convenience, partly for the Clifford algebra to actually encompass the physicist convention for the Lie algebra, and partly to encompass transformations that come from , not . Actually, not even the full  suffices. In order to encompass time reversal, one must have the set of all antilinear transformations as well. These are constructed using complex conjugation and an ordinary complex linear transformation. Best!	0|0|0|0|0|0

" I was thinking about this last night, and came to two conclusions: First, focusing solely on this article is not the way to go. I need to go back to square one and add academic rigor (if possible) to global warming and denialism. [Don't tell me GW is FA and is therefore academically rigorous; the FA star does not even come within discus-throwing distance of establishing an article as ""academically rigorous.""]. Second, your system of defending this Wikipedia page (notice I didn't say ""article"") is completely airtight, because you hold control over all of the definitions. Join any high school debate team and they'll tell you, if you own the definitions, you own the debate. And the problem here is this: you define anyone who disagrees with AGW as a ""denialist""; and you define everyone who agrees with you as an ""expert."" Done! The page is impregnable. Take forex the quote by Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer. Using her comments as supporting evidence of the page's (not ""article's) thesis is a flagrant act of POV that proves this page (not ""article"") is an op-ed piece from start to end. Barbara Boxer is a politician. Every bit of power, money and prestige she has comes from her ability to do one thing and thing only: to characterize herself as a noble public servant, and stereotype her opponents as villains, buffoons or both. Even more — and this is important — Barabara Boxer is not a run-of-the-mill politician. It would be nearly impossible to find someone more unwaveringly partisan than she is. In short, the Boxer quote is another bit that does not come close to passing the ""so what?"" test. I intend to delete that one sometime soon too. I also wonder whether I should give one of those damn wikicookie templates as a thank-you to the editors who revert me, every time they do so. Or maybe a barnstar?

" Camille Paglia: sex-positive feminist Here are the supporting links you asked for, you stupid twit!http://www.lotl.com/content/paglia.htmhttp://www.reference.com/browse/wiki/Sex-positive_feminismIf you are too lazy and full of yourself to read them in their entirety then I will just post the relevant sections here:Camille Paglia: ""On the other hand I’ve been saying in public for five years ago, as someone who’s endorsed prostitutes and strippers and that whole extreme of sex-positive experience, that I’m concerned about the effect on young people – people growing up from 8, 10, 14 in a climate where it’s gone to the opposite direction. I’m already out there concerned about this so I’m really outraged to be stereotyped in that way by her because I am a career teacher and yes, when you have a situation where commercialised sex is being pushed without a true eroticism…I’ve been saying this for years, that we have got to a point of meaningless exhibitionism without real eroticism. I’m for eroticism."" Camille Paglia is a major American social critic. Paglia's academic writing focuses on the role of vibrant dangerous sexuality in human history. Paglia's key importance to sex-positive feminism is not only her writings on sex, but her advocacy of ""traditional"" values like canon texts. Paglia is somewhat of an intellectual enigma, a conservative and academic feminist, who revels in low and high culture alike and celebrates sexualities disapproved of by mainstream Western culture. Paglia has, in many ways, presented a ""respectable"" face for pro-sex feminism to the world at large."	1|0|0|0|0|0

You should familiarize yourself with the situation before blocking editors.Under Wikipedia policy, under the 3RR rule, it states that leeway will be given to editors whose reverts undo vandalism and/or help improve the article. There is a solution to the edit warring that has been accepted by most editors. That is to leave the 3rd paragraph of the lede as is until objections/suggestions for improvements are proposed and approved by peers before edits are made to it, which is also according to Wikipedia guidelines for resolving conflict resolution. If you familiarize yourself with this from the Talk page, you'll observe that this is a case where certain editors continually make changes without discussion, without explanation, without stating their objections first, without submitting their proposed changes to peer review, and in direct defiance of the express will of most editors that this be done to resolve the warring. I am enforcing that majority will and implementing that solution, because despite my repeated requests for moderation and intervention from administrators, I have received absolutely no help to get this taken care of. If you would kindly just enforce policy and help the majority of editors to implement the agreed-upon solution by blocking those who continually edit the article while being completely unwilling to follow policy guidelines and make a reasonable effort to seek peer approval for changes.	0|0|0|0|0|0

" Some tips for making your stubs a bit better Apart from your over-reliance on Soccerway (which isn't always a WP:RS), I've noticed there are some other aspects of your created articles which need substantial improvement. Typing ""player who plays"" is poor English, try to put ""footballer who plays..."" or ""soccer player who represents..."" The word ""currently"" is pretty pointless too - I mean, they either play for the team or they don't, right? Also, try not to say they play for Bayern Munich in the Frauen-Bundesliga. Put of the Frauen-Bundesliga instead, because they play matches for their teams outside the league too. Please remember to always put the stub tags at the bottom of the article, this will draw attention to the fact that your creations require expansion and improvement. These are just small suggestions, but hopefully by taking this advice you will get better and eventually take some steps on the path to becoming a worthwhile contributor. Thanks,   "	0|0|0|0|0|0

"Pete, what makes you think you can go around and spread insults and personal attacks? What makes you think that you can call me ""arrogant"" and ""rude"" or kick me while I'm down? I would report you for this ongoing behavior of yours if only I wasn't blocked. But maybe someone will see my page and do just that.Further, my ""recruiting"" of other editors is irrelevant. If you read that post of mine on Yahoo, you'd see that I told everyone that, regardless of their position, I'd appreciate their presence. I was not trying to convince other people to come over and post with my POV in mind. The fact that someone did come over and post my POV was completely beyond my control.Finally, I did discuss these edits. I discussed them on the talk page for a week.

Manual of Style does say that existing date formats should be kept as-is, but before I came to edit that article, ISO dates prevailed and I've changed them to DMY dates.  Thus, I see no problems about moving this time to MDY dates, which, FWIW, I find to be much more readable.  Of course, I'm more than open to discussing this further. —  (talk | contribs)	0|0|0|0|0|0

I think the formula is correct as it stands. You can check it out on some test data eg: loan of 1 million for 20 years @ 10% monthly. Formula gives half life as 14.34 years: near as d.. to 172 months and using Excel's PV function for the remainder (68 months) we are a tad short of half way at 499401.52. With the minus sign in we get -5.66 years - oh dear! Derivation is from a 'continuous time mortgage model' where the balance on a mortgage P(t) is given by the equation: r=interest rate, T=time period of loan and P0 is the original loan amount. Once again this is something I have derived for myself but no doubt also once again there are more authoritative sources.	0|0|0|0|0|0

Non-involved people most definitely cannot understand Yeshivish. A nice example of Yeshivish is the English Yated Neeman, which can be found online at http://chareidi.shemayisrael.com . Many of their articles simply cannot be understood by a non-Jew or a non-Orthodox Jew. That is a simple fact. It is 99% English, but those few Hebrew (and Aramaic and Yiddish) words mixed in make many articles totally unreadable for the average person. I removed the disputed tag.

Not all scources are correct and it is unencyclopedic to call the British ""English"" as there are also Scots, Welsh, Cornish, and Irish people in Great Britian and calling them all ""English"" is not correct and ""English"" needs to be changed to British.

Re your AE topic ban appealSorry, but it strains credulity (mine, anyway) to believe that you didn't realize that the Adam Mickiewicz article was the subject of a dispute among Lithuanian and Polish editors with whom you are well-acquainted until the moment before you were going to hit save, as you state here . (Recent article/talk page history: , ). You haven't edited the article since 2007  and you must have  thousands of  other articles that need improvement on your watchlist.  You could have posted an article edit request to the PL noticeboard  re this, as you have for many articles during the past few months.In my view the A.M. part of your appeal demonstrates.. what to call it... a lack of forthcoming-ness. The remainder of the appeal, in which you speak of WP's losses from your lack of participation, that's a different story that others can think over. If you remove the A.M. section I shan't contest your appeal, since lifting your topic ban now or in March doesn't make much difference in the long run. But I am concerned about that part - possibly the readers will take your assertion at face value without checking the article/talk page histories. You could either remove that section (since it hasn't been commented on there yet) or strike it. If you choose not to do either, I may bring it up at the AE appeal. I'd prefer that we keep the conversation here, but if you'd rather have it on my talk page, that's OK by me - if so I'll post talkbacks.	0|0|0|0|0|0

In this particular case, the discussion was started by user Brad, who made a personal comment about me. Now, I dont mind this, I was more curious than offended, but the comment clearly ridicules the debate which I started on Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (ships)‎. You claimed that my post which you deleted was a 'POV inserted into a neutral notice'. It may have been a POV, about the desireability of starting any major change sooner rather than later, but this was in response to another comment suggesting that the proposed change would produce lots of work, and thus the implicit POV that it was undesireable. It was no more than a response in kind to the previous posting.  If you are going to start censoring postings, then I would suggest you do so impartially.  You did not censor the response in a way which restored the original section to a short notice, but merely removed one comment. Rather than restoring impartiality, this might be seen as biasing the tone of the debate.Far better that you do not delete anyones comments. I would suggest reading Wikipedia:No personal attacks. I'm not sure what deleting others posts comes under, try Wikipedia:Etiquette.	0|0|0|0|0|0

"Pretty much what I said the first day this was posted. Now, I have neither a problem with the Cabal's decision nor in the Cabal's logic (as Deamon138 does). My concern is why a vote that basically said ""I don't know"" means it stays at Burma. By the Cabal's conclusion...If the article had happened to be frozen at Myanmar before the mediation, and we had the same Cabal, it would now be a Myanmar article. I can see where the Myanmar side would be unhappy. However why should the Burma side agree to abide by the next decision? You can bet that with every panel of mediators that might side with Myanmar you will find at least as many panels that side with Burma. Husond is right, where does this end? When I first looked at this mess I said, and posted, that with the current evidence on both sides editors and mediators will NOT be able to reach a FAIR compromise that will appease both sides of this issue... no matter how much thought is put into it. There are good points for each argument. I'm in the Burma camp but that is how I see things. So I'm looking at 1) leave it where it is now, 2) split it into 2 identical articles, 3) some bizarre bot that switches it back and forth daily, 4) a new type of mediation that imho will not end this by any stretch of the imagination. Choice 4 just doesn't look that appealing.   "	0|0|0|0|0|0

The lead is quite unbalanced, as it is supposed to be a brief summary and introduction to the main text, and yet 1/3 is about historical-cultural-religious aspects of circumcision, which only occupies a small portion of the article itself.  I agree that information in the lead should be in the article under the relevant section, perhaps as the opening paragraph, but given there are already articles for religious practices, it is unnecessary in the lead.  It could be reduced to one, or two short sentences that state that there have been and still are historical, cultural and religious practices that involve circumcision - but without going into detail.  This is a medical article, and the use of circumcision as an initiation ritual is a different subject to medical circumcision.  Only where medical circumcision has itself become part of cultural practice should there be a focus on that manifestation of circumcision as cultural practice.	0|0|0|0|0|0

I understand quite well how evolution is supposed to work.  I understand the capriciousness and contingencies in the workings of evolution.   It is the paragraph in question, especially the example in that paragraph, which distorts the workings of evolution.  The phrase “it need only increase at a rate of 0.005 cm per generation (= 50 cm/10,000)” easily gives the impression of progressive linear change.  The anthropocentric notions of directionality and purpose often (I assume inadvertently) find their way into the writings of specialists who attempt to explain various forms of Darwinian evolution.  From these I have often read how evolution “invents” various forms and functions.  Carl Sagan, in my opinion one of the worst offenders in these matters, injected anthropocentric notions on a massive scale so as to justify his idea of a million highly advanced technological civilizations in the Galaxy.  I read your paragraph as suffering from the same notions of directionality.	0|0|0|0|0|0

With respect, you seem to be mistaking references found in some online media sources to usage in a whole country. Getting off the subject a little, but it does have some relevance, the NZ Herald routinely refers to NZ'ers of European descent as 'Pakeha', where as there are plenty who find this pejorative and insulating .. although this attitude is softening. Of course I would not include this in any article (and defintely not this one) without suitable reference lest it be deemed original research, I note it here as an example that the language of the media does not necessarily fully represent that of a country.What is very important to note is the skewed statistics of quoting the number of 'hits' for rooster found in NZ media. Many of these hits will be refering to the Australian league club Sydney Roosters and not the poultry. Clearly rugby is of very considerable greater interest to the country's readership than poultry.Just stating both 'Cockerel' and 'Rooster' are used is factual, whereas attempting to define relative usage is reliant on imprecise data, and data that is distorted towards an unrelated subject.Also, I can see no value to the article in trying to rank relative usage when both 'Cockerel' or 'Rooster' are common.	0|0|0|0|0|0

Very few people know about the white stolen generations, that doesn't mean it is less valid it just means it is less known in the mainstream public.The ""Stolen Generations"" was where Aboriginal children were taken from their families and put into foster care or adopted.The ""White Stolen Generations"" was where white children were taken from their families and put into ""slave camps"" or adopted.Now you tell me how the white stolen generations is any less valid than the Stolen Generations? They were exactly the same, why can't you accept that?"	0|0|0|0|0|0

"JanetteDoe, I appreciate your finding and uploading the Rao articles.  However, this can easily become an endless discussion.  For some other Yadav-apologist will soon come along and find an even more obscure source than Rao, and then you—conscientious and rigorous to a degree that the Yadav apologists are not and have no intention, aware or unaware, of being—will go scurrying again for the article.  After that we all will try to interpret it, weighing the pros and cons, again to a degree the apologists will not, for they will be busy looking for the next roadblock to toss in our path.  I think we can't make the determination of whether Rao applies here or not, at least not yet.  Let the secondary sources do that.  We need to rely on recent scholarship, especially that in textbooks, published by academic presses and vetted both before and after publication by reviewers from a wide range of scholarly and journalistic backgrounds.  Two such books, by Susan Bayly and Christophe Jaffrelot, both widely used in universities around the world, both reviewed extensively in the literature, are being used in the article.  Let the article writing (or rewriting) proceed based on these (or similar) books.  Once the article has been fleshed out, we can come back to the issue of Rao.  Otherwise, nothing will get done, and those of us, who've taken time out from our other Wikipedia (not to speak RL) pursuits to attend to the article, will slowly walk away, out of touch and out of sympathy.  «Talk» "	0|0|0|0|0|0

"RSA Labss (Now EMC), MIT, and ACM are wrong? VQuaker.  I am used to accepting correction when it is due, but for the life of me I cannot understand why cited information from a primary source (RSA Labs) on the fourth factor of authentication is not worth knowing.  I am confronted with the information that because it is not a legal requirement as far as you know, it must be spurious.  Some people know that it's better to get their legal information from government sources, not Wikipedia.  If you are holding up this resource as some type of CFR or USC guide, exposition, or sanctioned resource, then I believe the U.S. Government would like to hear your ideas.  Further, ""someone you know"" (or knows you) is part of network administrationwhich is part of the brilliance.  Needing a cohort or supervisor to provide a human factor is difficult to defeat.  Though, I suspect you know this already.  I'm not offended though, just immensely confused as to why this item of access control must be devoid of technical information and meet some arbitrary legal standard.  I would ask you this: if a user loses their SmartCard (i.e. CAC) and forgets their password, with the premise being that biometric devices or other inherence factor methodologies are not deployed, in most situations does an administrator with knowledge of the user ask they be terminated, or do they reissue credentials based on knowing the person?  There are organizations that will terminate you, but I couldn't have said that in my expounding of the 4th factor because it would mean citing information not available to the lay. (I do hope I can ""talk"" without citing what those in DF and IS would consider common knowledge.)  When we set out, it was to provide reliable information, if the mission has changed, well who could tell?  Consider me a non-contributor from now onwe aren't allowed to use Wikipedia anyway where I work, it is an anathema.  Say what you want unless it surprises someone and then an ego check is issued. I should expect nothing less, after all, I teach.  What changed the tone was your dumbing-down and use of nonsensical examples that could not be used to authenticate someone.  Smell?  Non-sequitur.  You gave me things to read, but I'm still waiting for you to cite Wikipedia's policy that information be legally sanctioned and in the format expected by a barrister.  I cited my sourcewhere is the citation that the language style, organization, and applicability be in-line with one or more regulatory bodies?Now a better way to be proactive would be to realize that academic databases (do you have access to them [Elsevier, JSTOR, EDAS, IEEE, SpringerLink], they can be pricey if you try and yet without them you're stuck in a Google funk, but I digress) are full of references to fourth factor.  That cash register key the manager uses when you return something, yep, someone you know.  An that's been around for decades!  Sign up for an account with an ISP, there it is again!  Take joy in knowing you have some sheriff star and are for the most part helpful.  I just didn't realize you alone set these standards.  I repent in ashes and wrend my sackcloth accordingly.

"1) Organisations also count as things.2) The section you quote from WP:NAME is in the section titled ""Use English words"", which goes on to say ""Sometimes the usual English version will differ somewhat from the local form as in Franz Josef Strauss; and rarely, as with Mount Everest, it will be completely different."" This is clearly a case where the ""usual English version"" differs somewhat.3) Wikipedia:Naming conventions (political parties) carries several exceptions: the third exception is ""Parties whose name is more commonly known by acronyms than their full name in international newsmedia."" Since GPV is more commonly known by its acronym, this naming convention does not apply.4) There is no problem with ambiguity, since there are no other topics in Wikipedia that carry the name GPV.  Even if there were, this article would then be named GPV (political party) to disambiguate them.In conclusion: please read naming conventions in full before quoting them to me.

Tangential Forces  The tangential forces (Coriolis and Euler) can be applied to a system but they don't occur naturally apart from perhaps in electromagnetism, but that is off topic.During the last week there was quite a bit of discussion going on about the Euler force and the oriolis force along with false allegations that I was confused between the two.We can apply a Coriolis force or an Euler force to a system if we like. The Euler force will increase the angular acceleration and the Coriolis force will change the direction of a constrained co-rotating radial motion.In a rotating frame of reference with non-uniform angular acceleration there will be a fictitious Euler force acting tangentially.In a Keplerian orbit, there will be zero tangential acceleration, although it is possible to see that this zero is the sum of an ongoing equal and opposite Euler force and Coriolis force.Having said all this, tangential forces are not highly relevant to this article. They could be mentioned in passing but the article is about a radial force. The centrifugal force is an outward radial force.More attempts should be made by the editors here to concentrate on differential equations in the 'radial distance' variable.They they might begin to get a feel for waht centrifugal force is all about.	0|0|0|0|0|0

Yes you're right, theologically Catholicism is very different to American protestantism which gave birth to the creationist movement and are certainly not interested in the sort of fundamentalist theocracy that most of them want.  Sure, they use the teleological argument, but phrase it in theological language which is a lot different from scientific language and hence it isn't pseudoscience, which is what irks me as a scientist.  But I don't understand theology (probably because I've been trained to think too scientifically).  And the Catholic Church most of the time has better things to do than make statements on scientific issues.  But Catholics are really into authority, so what the hierarchy says, goes. — Dunc|☺	0|0|0|0|0|0

" About Einstein My search of any document that might bear Einstein's name - in the League of Nations archive - in between 1930 - 1932 returns no results. See http://biblio-archive.unog.ch/archivplan.aspx.  By reviewing five books dealing with Einstein's work and life - not a single one mentioned this Einstein's support to the Ustase cause. Just one, written in German,Einstein: Sein Leben by Denis Brian, Christine von Samson-Mark, Wiley-VCH, 2005 page 352Indem er sich den Angelegenheiten seines eigenen Landes zuwandte, empoerte sich Einstein ueber deutsche Studenten, die fuer die Entlassung eines Professors agitierten, weil dieser ein Pazifist gegen politisch motivierte Todesurteile war. ""Es ist entsertzlich zu sehen, wie die unerfahrene Jugend fehlgeleitet wird"", schrieb er an das Berliner Tageblatt. ""Wenn dies so weitergeht, werden wir nach einer Tyrannei der Faschisten bei einer Herrschaft des Rotten Terrors ankommen."" Er glaubte, dass eine solche Herrschaft bereits in Jugoslawien ausgeloest worden sei und kritisierte die Landesregierung fuer den Mord an dem kroatischen Fuehrer, Professor Milan Sufflay, der Geschichte an der Universitaet von Zagreb gelehrt hatte.Reading further this book it is clear that the only information available to Einstein was 'The ""inside story"" of the Šufflay murder was given by the Croat journalist (Ustase propagandist), Slavko Cihlar, in the Berliner Tageblatt, February 26, 1931.'So, it is apparent that Einstein fell under spell of the Ustase propaganda. About the same propaganda, see:Appeal of the Croatian Academicians to the World of Civilisation: How the Croatian Savant, Professor of University, Dr. Milan Sufflay was Murdered by the Serbian Royal Dictatorshipby Croatian University clubs association, Zagreb, 1931 32 pageswhich was elaborated by ""Blood and Homeland"": Eugenics and Racial Nationalism in Central and Southeast Europe, 1900-1940by Marius Turda, Paul Weindling, Central European University Press, 2007 page 107Shortly afterwards, students from the Croatian University Club Association produced an English language pamphlet, How the Croatian Savant, Professor of University Dr. Milan Šufflay, was Murdered by the Serbian Royal Dictatorship, in which they appealed to European public opinion to recognize that the murder of Šufflay was the result of endeavors to build an absolutist South Slav state. In such a state, the ""European culture"" of Croatia and the Croatian was to be replaced by Serbian suzerainty, in which ""orthodox, byzantine, oriental-asiatic and oldtuc (sic) political and social traditions"" had been subsumed into a system ""not only contrary but also odious to European culture""Turda also says that ""His murder occasioned international condemnation and outrage from, among others, Albert Einstein and Heinrich Mann of the German League for the Rights of Man"" (no source was given)About the Sufflay murdererThinking about Yugoslavia: Scholarly Debates about the Yugoslav Breakup and the Wars in Bosnia and Kosovo by Sabrina P. Ramet, Cambridge University Press, 2005 page 254Goldstein (Croatian historian) leaves the question of agency to the side and writes simply that Šufflay, who, as he notes, was an accomplished observer of Albanian culture, 'was killed on the street in Zagreb. The killers were never found"" see also: Croatia: A Historyby Ivo Goldstein, translated by Nikolina Jovanovic,  McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP, 1999 - page 125About the same SufflayWomen, Gender, and Fascism in Europe, 1919-45: 1919-1945 By Kevin Passmore, Manchester University Press, 2003 page 115, Fascism in Croatia chapter: Ante Starcevic and Milan Šufflay, who used a demonic concept of Serbs as the cornerstone of their ideologies.Conflicts: Studies in Contemporary History by Lewis Bernstein Namier, Macmillan, 1942 page 49The racial theories of a Croat writer named Šufflay were taken up since Sufflay had held that the Croats were not Slavs like the Serbs, bu were descendants of a settlement of Goths.War and Revolution in Yugoslavia, 1941-1945: Occupation and Collaboration by Jozo TomasevichPublished by Stanford University Press, 2001 page 20:Sufflay was indicted in 1921 for espionage and connections with Croatian emigres and sentenced to athree year prison termBottom line: the story about Einstein's support to the Ustase cause is one-sided and even false.72.75.20.29  "	0|0|0|0|0|0

Thank you for this, but, if I understand correctly, you are assuming that the force is proportional to the magnitude of the apparent wind.  But the total force on the sails is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the apparent wind, so the forward force depends on the angle and on the square of the magnitude.  That is the relation that I used for the  135-degree table above.  But maybe I misundertand your formulas and your table.	0|0|0|0|0|0
A consistent conceptualization of phylogenies Phylogenies (i.e., dictomously branching processes) are processes that involve things, that is, objects, and as such have to be modeled by Object-Oriented Modeling in order to be consistent with the distinction of objects. Darwins model of evolution illustrates biological species as objects, and is thus no different from phylogenies of other kinds of objects (like asexually reproducing cells or mitochondria). Now, as an Object-Oriented Model, the model actually represents two consecutive objects (i.e., two objects in a row) by each of its internal lines (i.e., lines between nodes): one after a node and one before a node; the former belonging to the category (i.e., concept) 'objects after nodes' and the latter to the category 'objects before nodes'. If the model includes all objects of a certain category, then both of these make up this category. In summary: phylogenies consist of two categories (i.e., concepts) of objects: objects before nodes and objects after nodes, and if the phylogeny includes all things of a category, then these two categories make up this category.(Cladistics, or cladism as I prefer to call it, confuses the concept 'objects after nodes' with the concept 'objects before nodes' by defining lines between nodes as single things, thereby confusing category with object, that is kind with thing, thus confusing conceptualization itself. The approach is actually a return to a pre-scientific stage, this time denying the incompatibility between pattern and process instead of acknowledging it and solving it consistently. It is a return alley that no scientist had ever expected anyone to advocate. If this approach could ever be proved to be correct, then it would mean that reality only exists in our own heads. Luckily, Einstein's discovery that time is relative to space falsifies the approach (i.e., claim), and this it did even before the approach was born. Cladism was thus shown to be wrong before it emerged). Consist (presently at 83.254.20.53  )	0|0|0|0|0|0
hi!!! how are you today? I've been looking over your fetal alcohol work, and it's pretty sharp. my dad's a doc, and he did a lot of work at johns hokins with that, he looked at it too. good work.so, yeah the will mcwhinney article certainly has you all in a tizzy. I'm not looking to out anyone or anyhting, it's just gotten to the point that well, i think there's a reason, and other people too, to read about this fascinating community activist. I was telling Will beback, i've been a memebr of Sierra club since i was akid, my parents enlisted me and made some rather large donations in my name throughout my life, and i've done the same wiht my own children. It's a cool way to move things forward, like that movie, but hoefulyl much less trite. Anyhow.. what's the good word with you today? I think of our battles more like the old warner brothers cartoon with the coyote and the sheepdog, punching in before they set out to undermine one another. Because that's whats happening here, I'm actualyl writing some pretty solid stuff here, and you and will beback are bending over backwards to break rules and uphold them agaijnst me. Look, over at biff rose, there was a flargrant violation of the 3rr standard, and I pointed out that to Will beback that each time i made that violation, i was blocked and banned. i see that the person who did it this time was not blocked or banned. so you know, I've got a whole list of these that is being sandboxed by another ip, to follow up on, as i told will, you need to play fair for me to adhere to any standards you want to uphold. you can't just block an article, because true information is being disseminated through it. Well you can, but it's against the wiki rules, and so you are in violation, though i don't really think you care, anyhow, hope you keep your head above water, and I'l lsee you at the fights, so to speak.

"Your source states About the Black–White difference in IQ, which at the time was about 15 points, the Neisser et al. (1996) article stated, ""There is not much direct evidence on this point, but what there is fails to support a genetic hypothesis."" That conclusion stands today: There has been no new direct evidence on the question. (See Rushton & Jensen, 2005a, 2005b, Gottfredson, 2005, and Lynn & Vanhanen, 2002, for the view that the Black–White IQ difference is owing substantially to genetic differences between the races and that indirect evidence having to do with such factors as reaction time and brain size is probative. See Nisbett, 2005, 2009, for the view that the direct evidence indicates that thedifference between the races is entirely due to environmental factors and that the indirect evidence has little value.Please stop lying. 211.119.109.57  Then applying the same defintion to C the answer is no. Do you see the problem here? 211.119.109.57        Question C2: Is the ""Hereditiarian"" position a mainstream view?   The question is whether it is a widely held mainstream view that the IQ test score gap is likely to be significantly explainable by genetic factors. Note that the question is not whether it is the only mainstream view, nor whether it has been proven to account for the entire gap, but only about whether it is considered a probable explanation by a wide selection of mainstream scholars.   Yes. 211.119.109.57        Question D2: Is Richard Nisbett considered a mainstream scientist?   The question is whether Nisbett as a person and a scholar is generally considered to be within the mainstream of the field of Psychology. The question is not whether he is prominent and notable enough to be included, but about whether his views should be given equal weight to mainstream views within the article.      No. Nisbett holds a minority view which has been described as having 'virtually no chance of being true' by a reliable tertiary source. 211.119.109.57  "	0|0|0|0|0|0

Your argument is that we should take your word over that of the sources. All you have said is your own personal opinion and original research rather than facts supported by reliable sources.

You fail to mention the other two sources given, Forbes and Mastercard, both of which are American and based in New York City. Nor do you provide any sources supporting your notion that the City of London Corporation is a biased institution.

Legal Action Pending == I urge you to read the long history records on the Ronald Ryan article and discussion pages. There have been defamatory and false edits against Ryan and his living family menbers. We know meatpuppets are using various fake IPs to add false material and to removal of factual material. In one of many recent disgusting edits by meatpuppet/s, Ryan was accused of having sexual relations with his own daughter. In another disgusting edit Ryan was accused of being born a homosexual. Ryan is dead but his family members are alive to take legal action against these meatpuppets. Ryan’s surviving members of his family will continue to correct the distorted, manipulated opinions and views of one book author Mike Richards, whilst all other referenced material is ignored, vandalized and removed. The scapegoat/excuse being used by these meatpuppets is wrong as it is outrageous. Members of the Ryan family are alive and well. Supporters of Ronald Ryan will forever unite on the facts of his case and execution. We will continue to contribute the facts, based on the hundreds of references that diagree with Richards personal views. Facts like: There is no scientific evidence whatsoever to prove Ryan fired a shot. To put it bluntly, the meatpuppets refuse to allow any contributions on the facts of the Ryan case. Their hatred for Ryan is rather sick and disturbing to say the least.216.24.206.155  ==	0|0|0|0|0|0
Peer review I've spent the past six weeks overhauling the hip hop dance article and now that I've finished I posted it for peer review here. I decide to invite you to review it because you've edited this page in the past and based on you contribution history you tend to edit articles that have to do with music/entertainment. I would appreciate your feedback. Be forewarned that this is a long article. Not including refs/external links, templates, and categories it's 7 pages printed. If you accept my invitation to review you may want to print it first and make your edits that way. I found it easier to read and to correct when I did this. Although long, it makes for a good read during a lunch break, a bus ride, or pure boredom. I learned a lot myself while rewriting this article. If you like to learn, this could be an incentive for you.	0|0|0|0|0|0

I think I understand your position now. And that would certainly be effective at eliminating false credentials claims. However, it also would eliminate a great many true credentials claims, and the underlying premise of the proposal is that true claims are beneficial. You may disagree with that premise, but that's a different discussion. I would like to find a way to verify pseudonymous claims, while still generally preserving privacy. I do think that's possible within reason, although probably not in an absolutely fraud-proof way. As you point out in your opening contribution, the verifiers must be trusted since not just anyone could recheck (otherwise it wouldn't be preserve privacy).

:ActiveRainA tag has been placed on ActiveRain, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article seems to be blatant advertising which only promotes a company, product, group or service and which would need to be fundamentally rewritten in order to become an encyclopedia article. Please read the general criteria for speedy deletion, particularly item 11, as well as the guidelines on spam. If you can indicate why the subject of this article is not blatant advertising, you may contest the tagging. To do this, please add  on the top of the page and leave a note on the article's talk page explaining your position. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would help make it encyclopedic, as well as adding any citations from reliable sources to ensure that the article will be verifiable.

"UntitledAlso see: infobox vote Codes and ""minor"" state Please stop Since there is no definition of a ""minor"" state, there is no need to put it there. Is Algeria ""minor?"" Iran? It's a nonsense phrase, so it should be deleted. As for making ""MA"" a country code for Western Sahara, it's not. MA is a code for Morocco, and so it is in Morocco's infobox. EH was created for Western Sahara, so that is its country code. As far as the territory being occupied, this is a clear fact and the position of the United Nations; it is also mentioned in the article in other places. -❤T☮C☺M☯ It does not need a definition to be in the article. A minor state is used as opposed to super-power states, permanent members of the security council, ... etc. As to the EH domain, it clearly states the .eh tld is intended for WS but it is not assigned, "".MA"" being the one used in the territory. The same thing applies for the currency, the MAD is the currency of Morocco, but that is also the currency you will find in use in the territory. The same thing goes for the IAC 212, the Time zone +0 UTC, etc. They are the ones used in the territory. These things have been a matter of hotted debate before and they settled on the way they have been before you started tempering with them. As to your ridiculous claim of the UN considering the territory as occupied, I already explained to you the difference between a UN position through the security council that is reiterated again and again, and a voting poll in 1979 of the Algerian-Cuban drafted document, that has no obligation on the UN. The ""Zionism=Racism"" example is the brightest one for you to understand it. I will revert to the version that was in use before the anon IP started this mess.  It does Since ""minor states"" doesn't mean anything, you can't use it in this article; it's nonsense. What states that "".ma"" is being used in the territory? Do you have any evidence of this at all? The same thing does not apply to currency, since there is no administrative body that assigns currencies to regions. To ask which currency is used in a region is different than to ask which top-level domain name has been assigned to the region; the former is defined entirely by usage, the latter is defined entirely by standards. Western Sahara is clearly occupied, as the article itself still states; I'm not going through this with you again. -❤T☮C☺M☯  Ah we're back to having fun again arguing about trivialities. Minor states is indeed a value judgement - although arguably the states recognizing are largely minor on the global arena (Algeria is not a big newsmaker per se). But in the interest of neutrality, merely noting ""African, Asian, and Latin American"" states seems reasonable. At the same time, if Koavf gets to bleat on about minor, it seems reasonable that controlled be used rather than occupied. Same standards on language. (  ) Evidence on .ma usage would be found with sites for entities ostensibly domiciled in Western Sahara provinces using .ma. It is trivially easy to find that. Koavf's immature partisanship notwithstanding. (  )What is an example of a website with an .ma domain name which has the server in Western Sahara? « D. Trebbien (talk) 23:40 2008 May 5 (UTC) Good question. Since effectively all internet service to the Western Sahara is via Maroc Telecom or other Moroccan operators, one would expect that most servers would be located in Moroccan territory (ex-WS provinces), largely in the Casa-Rabat area. Technically I am unaware of any way to determine where the physical server is actually located (versus the service). Presumably the Regional Investment Office of Laayoune (http://www.laayouneinvest.ma/fr/index.asp) may have its server physically in Laayoune. Other similar offices may also. It strikes me as useful for the article to indicate like country code, most sites use the Moroccan address (.ma). Polisario partisans may not like that, but its effective reality.

SOCK PUPPETRY? IS USING ANY ACCOUNT WHATSOEVER CONSIDERED SOCK PUPPETRY? This site is a complete joke. I can't even edit using a *verifiable* account without being accused of violating some concocted offense. My address was censored because I was using an account which was apparently improperly named, so I am now using one that IS properly named (AFTER the probation period) and that in and of itself is apparently an offense. Logically, what is going on is that I am being unable to contribute in any way whatsoever because I am being repeatedly punished for a first offense spawned from ignorance. What kind of site are you people trying to run here?! It's no wonder the main founder of wikipedia turned his back on it when it's become such a blatant travesty of the intellectual honesty it purports to espouse. I have continuously been censored for editing a biased article- an article which is continuously edited by self-avowed marxists and anti-zionists (the very same people whose POV the article unashamedly puts forward). What kind of encyclopedia has articles that put forward opinion verified by echo chamber sources? If any editor attempted to put that sort of trash in Britannica they would be quickly disassociated with the publication- but it's quite apparent that Wikipedia has no controls whatsoever and has chosen to let the patients run the asylum. There is no use in attempting to run an objective and educational publication when the very people who have discredited the internet as a source of information are allowed to manipulate the site by sourcing the same intellectually dishonest sites that people use wikipedia to avoid. In short, explain yourselves- particularly Roland Rance, who has manipulated his position on this site to censor any points he disagrees with- all without explaining why. When you stop accepting the ridiculous assumption that senior members are beyond reproach, perhaps the site will gain some semblance of credibility. As it stands, wikipedia is just another example persistence winning over intelligence.	0|0|0|0|0|0

"Midwest AccentI see that you are deleting my corrections regarding the General American accent, in the article ""Midwest,"" which quite wrongly implies that General American is owned lock stock and barrel by that region.  It's nonsense. The General American accent is spoken all over the north, from Seattle to Connecticut. You are going to have to come up with some citations which realistically and accurately show that the northern accent originated in or is unique to the Midwest, before I'kk allow you continue deleting my writings without a fight. It certainly is not unique to the Midwest, a region which was not even settled by English speakers until barely 150 years ago, after the northern accent was known to exist in places like Pennsylvania and upstate NY, and Connecticut. It really bugs me to see the Midwest taking ownership of an accent which began in the Northeast. The original author blunders badly by lumping the accents of certain urban areas of the northeast in with the rural areas. Anybody from my region, the Syracuse, NY area, formerly Albany, NY, knows that our accent it totally indistinguishable from that of the Midwest. I challange anybody to put a group of Midwestern speakers side-by-side with upstate New Yorkers, and tell which is which. It's impossible, it's the same accent, utterly and completely the same. And we've been speaking this way since before the Midwest was even settled, so it's nonsense to say it's a Midwest accent."	0|0|0|0|0|0

"Mario Party 4 is the fourth in a series of board game style video games for Nintendo platforms, featuring popular Nintendo characters. It was released on the Nintendo GameCube in North America on October 21, 2002 strangely before the Japanese release on November 8, 2002. It was released on November 29, 2002 in Europe, being heavily criticised for being 'Nintendo's big GameCube Game' for Christmas 2002 as Metroid Prime was delayed until March 2003.Mario Party 4 was the first Mario Party that was released on the Nintendo GameCube. Each board had its own host, including Toad, Goomba, Shy Guy, Koopa, and Boo. Mario Party 4 also contains some characters new to the franchise; Thwomp and Whomp. Klepto, Dolphin, Lakitu, and Star, along with two completely new characters named Genie of the Lamp and Ztar, are included as well. Mario Party 4 retains the Story Mode found in Mario Party 3.The game, as usual, contains a standard party mode in which up to four players play through a board, trying to collect as many Stars as possible. The Star Space would appear randomly on the board, and players would have to reach it before anyone else. However, the Stars carry a price tag of 20 coins, and player has to earn those coins by winning minigames, which take place at the end of each turn (after all the players have rolled the Dice Block, which will always roll a number from one to ten).Battle minigames are like the 4-player games, but generally (with many exceptions) a little more elaborate. Battle games are usually tense because every player has to put a certain number of coins (from 5 - 50) into a pot. First place gets 70% of the pot, second place gets 30%, and a random player gets any coins lost in rounding. Every Mario Party contains 60 to 80 minigames of a few different types. Four-player games are a free-for-all in which all players compete against each other. 2-on-2 and 1-on-3 minigames put players in groups, so they have to cooperate in the minigame to win, even though they are against each other in the main game. In most situations, winners of these games make 10 coins each.A new addition to the Mario Party series was the Bowser mini-games. Players play in a very elaborate mini-game that ends when one player is eliminated in various ways. (See Bowser mini-game section below) The loser loses a pre-specified item, usually coins or items.GameplayBoards Toad's Midway Madness Goomba's Greedy Gala Koopa's Seaside Soiree Shy Guy's Jungle Jam Boo's Haunted Bash Bowser's Gnarly Party (Clear Story Mode to unlock it)SpacesThere is various spaces you can land in the game. The following is a list of them, and what they do.Blue Space - You get three coins. Also, there is a special feature on this game called Hidden Blocks, in which a star or coins may be hidden on random blue spaces.Red Space - You lose three coins.Green Happening Space - A special board event takes place.Warp Space - You are sent to the same space as an opponent. A spinner chooses which opponent's space you will warp to.Mushroom Space - Two boxes will appear (one big and one small). Choose one, and you will be given either a Mini Mushroom or a Mega Mushroom. (Note: The Mega Mushroom is not always in the large box, and the Mini Mushroom is not always in the small box.)Battle Space - A battle minigame will start in which players put a chosen amount of coins into a pot. The better you finish in the minigame, the more coins you will get back from the pot.Bowser Space - Bowser may steal items from players or a Bowser minigame may begin.Fortune Space - A reversal of fortune begins, in which players may have to give coins or stars to others.

, 24 December 2008 (UTC)Perhaps for not the first time, I find myself in complete agreement with Ottava. Caulde is a young editor, and in the interests of full disclosure he and I have had run-ins in the past, over his claiming credit for work that he had not actually done. He knew better than me how to play the system. He is now an administrator, and I will never be an administrator. Go figure. I bear Caulde no ill will; he learned how to play the system and I didn't bother to take the same trouble. Maybe that's why there's a unhealthy preponderance of kiddie-admins?

" October 2011 (UTC)Hi Tom, I understand and you don't have to convince me of the similarities, it's just that WP requires citations to reliable sources, in this case where the author of a book or a music paper article or a professional website like AllMusic has made the connection. So those examples above, though worthwhile in themselves, don't solve the 'citation needed' issue. However I'm sure I've seen the ""Mona"" / ""How Soon Is Now"" connection made in at least one book on The Smiths so let me scout around and see if I can find it.

" Hie DVdm. I was writing what follows while you made your edit. I can't right now, but I will coming to review in detail your example.Thanks Johnuniq for your advice and input. Concerning the actual statement, I had already thought that after clearing things up with DVdm, I would rephrase it into something in the lines of ""He is an iconic and inspirational reference for the generation growing up in the late 1970s, early 1980s."" Adding ""to some of the generation"" should clear your objection about the absence of stats. But that's not the really important issue here. The fact is that it is ethically improper from me and from Wikipedia to declare that the (you call it blog) site is not a reliable source here, but then find that the links and statements in ""Inertia Coupling"" or ""Alexander Abian"" are significant enriching contributions to the users of Wikipedia, and the sourced site is reliable there. BTW, in these two and the few other topics the source is mentioned, the statements leading to the source links would qualify as synthesis. It would be highly objectionable from Wikipedia to keep those links unchallenged for the time being, and when someone gets around to rewriting the original material in the specific blog posts, the links will be trashed out. At this point 1) The sentence being vague and inaccurate can be corrected. 2) It seems that if you articulate a sentence validated by some sort of source that is not a direct quote, in most cases some synthesis is involved. 3) There is still the issue of the site being a reliable source. It seems to me that the Wikipedia efforts to keep the wackos with weird theories at bay, is leading editors to substitute verifiability, intelligibility and common sense by arguments of authority. This would set me going into a long winded argument about what is happening to Wikipedia, once lauded as the place ""to come as you are,"" becoming stiff, purely factual and tight in such a way that it carries a lot of knowledge but no understanding. This in turn carries into a discussion about public education, and the work that Carl Sagan is known to the general public for. Cosmos was not about this marble statue said so but instead these are the reasons why we think so. To me the posts in the disputed site I linked to are interesting (but that maybe just my own personal opinion) and Wikipedia users having them available is positive, constructive and enriching for Wikipedia, and that's the reason I linked to them in the first place. Throwing them out, all of them, seems like excluding a whole plethora of good things, the baby with the bath water, because a Wikipedia directive says so, just because it does, not noticing the directives were written to prevent bad things from happening, it would seem to me, not to exclude good things by statute. So the reliable source rules are something I would like to discuss a bit more at length.   "	0|0|0|0|0|0

The particular section lists what has been claimed in rebuttal to the code theft charge.  That the claims regarding the significance of C to C++ translation and 64 bit conversion seem spurious, false or dubious to C/C++ programmers are acknowledged.  That the Medievia web page makes blatantly false statements about dates, the origination of other muds, and the significance of the above I also acknowledge.  I don't believe the article section is about uncovering the truth of their claims.  The only fact necessary to presenting that viewpoint is that they've claimed it.  Also presenting a lengthy history of public proclamations and announcements by the games principals which contradict their own official web history page is beyond the scope, I think, of what most people care about.	0|0|0|0|0|0

"Firstly, some of the examples you used were from the personal attack pages...maybe you should read your own posts?  Also, the reason I decided they were inane and decided to ignore them was because they did not directly apply to what I had said.  Perhaps they applied to the numerous inferences that you made in reference to what I said but they did not apply to what I said and meant.  Perhaps you could try not to infer or assume what I mean and try not to take offense so easily.  I am respecting the basic rules of Wikipedia, but I also exploited ""loop holes"" in the rules.  So if you want to include what I did in the rules then do so, but you should state what you want and not infer your own meaning.  And I'm so upset because you and several other people have been complete and total assholes to me and to another person who tried to post this same page.  You asked that we do something, i.e. explain the significance of the clan, etc, and we did but you deleted it anyway.  And then you ask for more stuff and you give it to us.  Also, one of the pages I read on here says that the information has to be verifiable but not the truth...well what kind of bullshit is that?  If this is truly an encyclopedia then dont you state the truth?  Also, if I go and post some article some other place rather than the clans home page then I can site that and it becomes verifiable right?  If you say no, then this is just another example of something that is not explicitly stated and a loop hole that people can exploit.

"ElellandHello HumusI am sorry if I have placed this note in the wrong spot. I m very inexperienced with Wikipedia. I was enthralled by Wikipedia. Initially. That is until I met Eleland. I noticed that you had some interesting discussions with Eleland. Eleland engineered a small article which I contributed some information to be deleted. He organised a ""kangaroo court"" made duplicitous unfounded claims and then set up a false consensus.The Article was on Ed O'Loughlin Fairfax publishing MidEast correspondent. The said individual has a unfortunate habit of mixing reporting and commentary. He was amongst the candidates for this year's HR.com dishonest reporter award - despite being in the Australia only catchment area - so you can imagine the quality of his journalism.Anyway Eleland did a great job of protecting him and got the article deleted.So I studied Eleland a little.I've looked at over 100 of his posts on the Arab Israel conflict. More than 95 were directly anti-Israel. His modus has been generally to unfairly rubbish the references of the pro-Israel side. In this way he has undermined many many articles.Personally I don't care what his opinion is, but when he uses his editorial power and influence at Wikipedia to falsely invalidate, delete, manipulate etc. I think there is a problem.Wikipedia is, I am afraid, beginning to read like Eleland wrote the script.Who is Eleland?

As far as I know there were no warrants of arrest for Thomas Jefferson from the British Crown.  There is nothing in the writings of Thomas Jefferson that states he was committing treason and could be hung.  Jefferson, Washingtion, and Adams, according to Ferling (2000) believed they were slaves to the British government, not having any rights.  They did not view themselves as outlaw rebels, rather, they wanted to be free to make their own laws that protected white people.  Franklin apparently is the only Founding Father who mentioned being hung. Was Jefferson in the room at the time Franklin made this statement?	0|0|0|0|0|0

" Misleading reference to study? In the section on lead paint in art (which I largely wrote), someone added the following:""Lead paint will often become discolored over long periods of time. This is due to the reaction of the lead carbonate in the paint with traces of hydrogen sulfide in the air and with acids, often from fingerprints. [2] As a result, many older works of art that used lead paint now show some discoloration.""As I found this surprising, I went and carefully read the study being cited. Their research seemed to refer only to lead in aqueous media on paper, although that wasn't absolutely clear. But lead paint is almost never used that way! Artists working in transparent watercolor (aquarelle) don't usually use white paint, or just occasionally a bit of ""Chinese White"" (not lead) to make corrections. And opaque watercolors (gouache) and acrylic (polymer) artist's paints typically use titanium dioxide or (rarely) zinc white, but never lead. Normally ""flake white"" is used only by oil painters, and there's no indication in the study that they were referring to oil paints. Cooperstown is a well-respected institution, but as of now I'm sticking with the classic (Ralph Mayer). Flake white may get *slightly* yellowish after centuries, but nothing like the gross discoloration referred to in the paragraph above. If someone has more information on this, please mention it here; otherwise when I come back I'm going to delete that paragraph or water it down (no pun intended)."	0|0|0|0|0|0

Did you even look at my edit before reverting it? I did change it up as you wanted to say that Rex thinks it doesnt work.  and as you said, it hits on many things that are also said elsewhere in the article, making it perfect for the lead.  Just because it is stated elsewhere in the article by other sources doesn't mean we can also use this source.  The more sources the better.  I would suggest we both stop touching the article until you come up with a clear reason why it shouldn't be added.  As I know all too well how this works, no one touches it in order to finish this dispute, and then the person who didn't want the information in the article will just stop discussing because they think they have won. and then revert whenever the page gets changed.	0|0|0|0|0|0

There is definately a major difference between caucasian and white.  Users slrubenstein and alun are definately taking a racist stance toward this article, and both sides can throw up rules and regs set by wikipedia to hide behind and attempt to justify your points of view (cited sources or not, it's obvious your point of view determines which sources you cite, and or choose not to), but this article as it exists is just wrong.  I believe wikipedia would be better served by deleting this article, and adding a new sub-section in the races and caucasian articles if it this is not changed to reflect what 99.9% of the people on this earth consider a 'white person' to be, this 99.9% obviously not including alun & slrubenstein.  When it comes down to it, the term 'white person' can't really be defined, it's technically not a race, and any references sited are going to be garbage, as you can find hundreds of them from what could be considered reliable sources that directly defy one another.  All that could be done for this article would be to direct it towards a view that most people agree with, or delete it entirely, but as it currently exists, I say again it's a joke.  You can cite all the references you want, and state all the wikipedia rules you want, you just can't understand that what you believe just isn't what an overwhelming majority of the rest of the human race does, and as I said before, there's no way of either side proving the case for either side here, as 'white people' don't scientifically exist.  So, since you guys are obviously the type that will fight to the bitter end for some worthless cause, even though you have to know that most everyone disagrees with your understanding of what a 'white person' is, just do us all a favor and either delete this article (since there is no factual ground for either side to stand on), or just accept that the overwhelming majority of people see this differently from you, get over it, and let the majority rule on this article about a group of people that doesn't scientifically exist. /end commafest 2009	0|0|0|0|0|0

"Addressing:While ""Indian tribe"" is official US Gov't lingo, saying ""tribe"" twice in the first sentence and then again in the second is awkward, also ""the tribe"" is not a monolithic entity, but rather a collection of people - so maybe reword to say something like ""The Coeur d'Alene people once inhabited 3,500,000 acres (1,400,000 ha) in northern Idaho and Washington,[2][3] (And Montana, actually, note article on the tribe) but today, the only land controlled by the tribal nation is the Coeur d'Alene Reservation in Benewah and Kootenai counties, Idaho.[4]"" You don't have to use my wording, but you see how I am distinguishing land and people, though the two are, of course, closely intertwined.  .  Boomer!  Second and third paragraphs jump around and need another copyedit. I'd put right up front that Johnson did the executive order but Congress never acted on it, then go on about how the tribe didn't accept it anyway?  Keep the chronology clearer.   (Interesting that the Coeur d'Alene article says nothing about this period, maybe finish here and add a bit to that article too... hmmm) From a VERY cursory review of the decision, it appears that gap between creation of the reservation and Idaho's statehood becomes significant in this case, so perhaps give us a bit of foreshadowing that this is not just a dry fact, but it's something that's going to matter.  The section fails to draw out the significance of the info on the state park and mining, maybe add a wee bit to hint at why this will matter in the SCOTUS case."	0|0|0|0|0|0

" Pseudonymous editing copied from an email received offlineHi,I'm not quite sure how this works, but your wrote in my deletion review, ""you say that your name and address are available, but your contributions to Wikipedia are pseudonymous.""Does this mean I hadn't registered? I did so last night, and not under a pseudonym as most people have. I always use my real name in signatures.And I don't know how to post to your talk page because there appears to be no ""post"" link.Thanks,Dennis Bathory-Kitszbathory@bathory.orgbathory@maltedmedia.comThanks for your message but I think perhaps my meaning was still unclear.  Whether you register or not doesn't really matter since anyone can register under any name.  I could go online and register a Wikipedia account as George W. Bush (at least, if it's not already taken).  Wikipedia has no means to authenticate your identity independently.  All that we know - all that we can know - is what you choose to claim about yourself.  That's what I meant by pseudonymously - any registration, even if you say that it's your real name, is technically a pseudonym.  It is not independently verified against some external identity database.  And for the most part, that works out very well on Wikipedia.  We want users and editors to establish themselves through their actions and to demonstrate their expertise through their edits, not by making claims to outside credentials.By the way, anyone could also register as Dennis Bathory-Kitzs.  That trivial misspelling would be easily overlooked by readers but would still be accepted by the system.  Such a person could sign their name the same way you do, attempt to mimic your pattern of speech (well, writing really) and make subtle edits just to discredit you.  That, in fact, is a real problem for established editors of Wikipedia.  When we find usernames that are suspiciously similar to established users, we look very carefully for signs of vandalism or deceit.  Users who appear to have done something like that on purpose are generally banned from Wikipedia.  But those are all manual checks.  There is no system that can automatically detect or prevent it.Likewise, no one can inherently trust the email address.  The way internet domains are set up, anyone could register bathory.org and create any email name they wanted.  Like Wikipedia accounts, emails and internet domains are unverified against any external identity authority.  And that's before you consider the problems of email spoofing and forgery - both of which are far easier and common today than any of us would like to admit.Most people are honest.  But there are enough dishonest people out there that we have to build our systems and our procedures in such a way that it doesn't matter whether they are telling the truth about their identity or not.  That's why Wikipedia has a policy against original research (which we mean as ""a contribution or assertion based on personal experience"") and why we never rely solely on self-published materials and why we bias our policy so strongly in favor of reliable sources such as websites owned by and operated by large, well-known organizations - organizations with both a vested interest in and the resources to find and stop spoofing.Sorry to bore you with all this but my non-Wikipedia profession is information security.  The inherent problems of identity management and authentication occupy much of my waking hours.  How can a bank know that you're really you?  And how far can that trust be extended?  Under what conditions can an assertion be treated as reliable?  How do we balance that against the need to make systems and computers easy and accessible.  Unfortunately, there are no easy answers short of establishing a national identity database - something which would be in great tension with my role as a privacy advocate.  Anyway, I'll get off my soapbox now.  Thanks for your message.To post to my Talk page, just go to the page and edit it like you would edit any page on Wikipedia.  The most common technique is to use the little plus sign next to the ""edit this page"" tab at the top.  That will automatically create a new section and give you a line to create a section header without having to know the wiki-markup symbols.  You should also get in the habit of signing your posts on Talk pages.  You can do that easily by ending your comment with four tildes (~~~~).  When you save the page, the MediaWiki software will replace the tildes with your username and the date-timestamp.Again, welcome to Wikipedia.   (talk) "	0|0|0|0|0|0

"::The CTMU is not passing itself off as an ""academic"" theory. It can't, because Langan is not a member of academia. But then again, a theory need not be academic to be notable. For example, print and television journalists and their readers and viewing audiences can deem things notable as well. Nor do academics have a monopoly on logical or factual correctness, scholarly integrity, or intellectual merit, except possibly in the well-indoctrinated minds of some academics themselves (and of course, their aspiring apprentices, whose eager anticipation of scholastic glory sometimes inflates their academic snobbery to blimpish proportions).Byrgenwulf complains that ""we chaps"" are not the sole arbiters of what belongs in the article. This is correct. To his credit, he invites others to tag his assertions. However, this is a bit specious, for having belatedly come to the realization that he has no relevant, verifiable assertions to make, he is now specializing in challenging the assertions of others. Thus, we now find him imperiously and rather comically demanding that every one of Langan's assertions receive a separate citation, when this is flatly unnecessary because the source material in which those assertions are made is already directly linked to the article. It is important for Byrgenwulf to understand that he has exactly the same burden of proof as his opponents. Not only must he provide a legitimate citation for anything he wishes to add to the article, but given that the article already links to ample source material, anything he wants to remove or qualify must be proven false, irrelevant, or non-neutral. Unfortunately, he hasn't yet been able to lock onto this signal. He still labors under the assumption that like some sort of Ultimate Bureaucrat, he can sit at his keyboard and demand an infinite amount of verification without verifying anything himself.  By now, everyone involved in this matter has come to a stark realization: neither Byrgenwulf, nor any of his tiny but dedicated band of confederates, HAS any citations or other sources of verification for their own accusations. They are merely using the article, which is faithful to the material it cites, to prosecute their philosophical bias against its topic, the CTMU, which was deemed notable and newsworthy by several international periodicals and news networks. They do not like what the CTMU says; the article on the CTMU reports on what the CTMU says, and what Langan and the press say about the CTMU; hence, they do not like the article on the CTMU. This conflation of the article with the theory is reflected in Byrgenwulf's transparent strategy of attacking the theory through the article, attempting to dispose of the message by killing the messenger. Meanwhile, he seemingly fails to register the fact that he is himself in glaring violation of Wikipedia verifiability policy, and that his all-too-evident editorial bias is in massive violation of NPOV as well. Oozing contempt, Byrgenwulf has rumbled into the middle of the CTMU article with a load of summary demands, snide remarks, and self-righteous, factually worthless criticism...but not one relevant citation in hand! Nothing he says is verifiable; as we have now repeatedly seen, he cannot even be trusted on matters in which he claims to be an expert. This makes it very difficult, if not impossible, to take his demands seriously.         "	0|0|0|0|0|0

", 20 September 2011 (UTC)I'll try to take the points in turn. Hope I get this format right. - WP:BLPGOSSIP states that Be wary of sources that use weasel words and that attribute material to anonymous sources. I am not aware of any weasel words or attribution to anonymous sources. I am not sure how the section applies, if you could be more clear it would be helpful. - The phrase involve claims about third parties is so vague as to not be any assistance. By this metric, so little can be used that it's almost meaningless. Someone stating their birthdate, or the grade school they attended. But for a person saying ""I have a conflict with Jenny Smith over Issue X"" - where do we draw the line? It could easily be said that an actor and actress divorcing, with one placing on their personal (publicist) website a statement about ""separating for reasons of X"" is a ""claim about third parties"", but I wouldn't argue it is unreliable nor unencyclopedic to include in the biography of either individual. One can take things too far, and I think in this case the avoidance of even mentioning the existence of dispute is getting to the point where people are being literalist and not using their common sense. 76.31.236.91  20:51"	0|0|0|0|0|0

Mr. 68.164.117.79 I don't mean to be frank but your title does assert that SO is a de factor a country when only a handful number of countries recognizes it as such, The majority of the world still see it as a part of Georgia after all it was and is a civilwar. On top of that South Ossetians & Abkahzians are Russian citizens so this would mean that they are in fact part of the Russian Federation. This is also the problem logically, to call it as such, is to recognize the regional sovereignty of that area therefore confirming that the region exist but many speak of it which confirms it's existence now that the region is confirmed to exist what is this region part of? It is for the most part still the Georgian region its more to do with logic then POV. My friend Mr 68.164.117.79 I'm trying front with you whatsoever but that statement SO War doesn't make sense to me. However I think that the solution is probably like Pubkjre said in regards to the Vietnam article but this needs to stop any title can seem that it has a POV and can have great arguments to support it even though the title has good intentions so to debate it any further wouldn't do good, every informational data base has a bias its just a question of how much.Furthermore I'm going to also defend the google searches because it a good way to see how many individuals speak of in reference to, I am not saying that because everyone calls it as such then it should be so, but the easier it is to find the better as illogical as that sounds.In Summation I second Pubkjre we should have a Etymology page that way it will be clear on who is using what name and why.	0|0|0|0|0|0

"Whenever you see brackets that means that the editor has added an explanation.  In this case [organic remains] was added to explain the word 'they'.  While W&M; used the word fossil in the previous sentence it is clear that they were referring to organic remains because by definition, recently buried remains (such as what is ""now occurring"") are not fossils.  From the ""Dictionary of Geologic Terms"", 3rd edition, 1984, by Bates and Johnson:  FOSSIL:  Any remains, trace, or imprint of a plant or animal that has been preserved in the earth's crust since some past geologic or prehistoric time.  Nothing buried in the present can be a fossil, for it is in historic time.  And further, you do not quickly bury fossils to preserve them, you quickly bury organic remains to protected them long enough so they they can eventually become fossils in some future geologic era.W&M; likely used the term fossil loosely, like many editors of this WP page, to refer to organic remains that might become fossils per definition in some geologic era in the future.  It is unfortunate that W&M; were not as precise as they might have been, because uninformed people, such as Talk.Origins, misunderstand and twist what they said.As much impact as W&M; have had on Creationary thought, nearly all fellow creationist today recognize that The Genesis Flood, is now way out of date.  Modern creationary geologists have moved well beyond The Genesis Flood.  When critics quote it, it displays their complete lack of competency on modern creationism.   "	0|0|0|0|0|0

" Question Sarah, there is something that I've wondered about for a long time that is related to COI editing.  One need look no further than my user page where I quote Chris Hedges: ""They control our systems of information."" and add: Surely no one could be so naive as to believe that corporations do not have an interest in turning our encyclopedia into a corporate-approved encyclopedia.  At a certain point one must admit that to not fight the creep of corporate control into our articles really does make us appear to be a bunch of easily-led, lame-brained, losers just willing to go along with the flow rather than to tackle the problem and try to come up with some sort of strategy.  What, if anything, is presently being done?  I'm aware that a few years ago an editor asked for some sort of outside check to ""prove"" that he had no COI related to the articles he edits, and I've heard of this incident dozens of times since, where it is raised as absolute evidence of a lack of conflict of interest.  Many times I've wondered how Wikipedia went about finding this so-called proof. If I put myself in a position in which I was editing for pay but denied it, how could it be proven that I was?  I mention this because the first thing you know all a paid editor need do is have WP give him/her the WP Stamp of Approval and from then on that editor is home free to do as they please.  They can now proudly display their badge of approval and anyone who questions them is now seen as a disgruntled editor in need of a reality check.    "	0|0|0|0|0|0

An idea can not be un-scientific.  Methodology can, however.  The arguments against Hoagland's methods of forming conclusions are justified.  Ruling out planetary migration, on the other hand, is unscientific.  The reality is that we are sending ever larger and more sophisticated payloads to Mars.  Assuming technology continues to move forward those payloads will eventually be able to handle life support and such.  The US government thinks they can get people there in the next 15 to 20 years.  Nothing in Physics rules it out.

My 2c to get beyond the stalemale is to let skeptics raise all controversies surrounding chiropractic, find the best sources to neutrally present the material and roll into into a Criticisms section.  Then those who really care about intricacies and details of the chiropractic story can get on with the show and make the article interesting and not some big stats/research battleground.  For the record, I completely agree 100% that effectiveness of chiropractic care is well established for low back disorders (just as good if not better) that manual therapy is effectiveness in neck pain (Task Force 2008) that the results seem favourable for certain types of headaches (TTH, migraine, cervicogenic/headache of cervical origin) and inconclusive and controversial for non-musculoskeletal disorders.  Part of effectiveness too is patient satisfaction scores which patients routinely display a far greater preference for chiropractic care than medical care for LBP.  This is the most succint and precise summary there is.  We can toss the reference in and call it a day.  A majority of editors agree that the current and past evidence, both in research and 3rd parties (governments) favours chiropractic care.  We can't let Ernst' conclusions (which have been rebutted and invalidated) skew what is now generally accepted.  Notice the terms too, generally, etc.	0|0|0|0|0|0

What I am interested in is seeing Wikipedia be an respected and accurate source of free information for those who seek it, and when the Wikipedia staff themselves engage in an organised effort to remove accurate information with no justification whatsoever (we normally call this [Wikipedia:Vandalism|vandalism]), Wikipedia's credibility goes out the window.

This entry was deleted by its author, owing to the fact that it contains research which is being distorted somewhat. Since it's a part of an ongoing research piece by a working journalist, I've decided that any distorition to the research could be problematic. Thus, the simplest thing to do in order to avoid antagonizations, distortions, etc, is to remove it. Since you have decided to continue this antagonization, I am left with no alternative but to report you to those in a place of authority at Wikipedia. Of course, you may feel free to complete and post your own research on the Havana shipyards however, I've decided the best course of action is to register the copyright on all pertinent research statements and images associated with this article. Use of any of the above by persons other than the author, without his permission, is in violation of international copyright standards and will be promplty reported to the FCC (Federal Communications Commission) and all other pertinent authorities.	0|0|0|0|0|0

I think that the infobox should at least have a picture of Muhammad, if there is to be one anywhere.  The image for the page on Muhammad should be a depiction of Muhammad.  Having calligraphy or symbolism replace an actual picture would not be in the spirit of wikipedia.  Regrettably, it will offend some people, but that is not, nor should be, the impetus behind any decision.  A picture of Muhammad would be more encyclopedic and offer more knowledge, therefore, it is the only real option if this is to remain a truly neutral place to obtain knowledge.  Also, I feel like there is an overabundance of images in this article.  Lots of images of redundant or mildly irrelevant things, as if people are unconsciously putting in different images because they feel bad about putting in an image of Muhammad.	0|0|0|0|0|0

" Colorado balloon incident Greetings. I reverted your addition of a news photograph of the Colorado balloon incident balloon. Unfortunately, Wikipedia's use is exactly like the commercial use for commercial news photography. As the template you used states: ""Use of historic images from press agencies must only be used in a transformative nature, when the image itself is the subject of commentary rather than the event it depicts"".  It's intended for images which are themselves iconic works of art so that we can use the images to primarily facilitate discussion of the image. Even ignoring the legal problems with using the news photography: Wikipedia has a hard requirement for freely licensed images because non-free media compromises the freely licensed status of Wikipedia. Refer to the first rule at WP:NFCC; non-free images are not to be used unless obtaining a freely licensed could not be reasonably believed to be possible. There were undoubtedly thousands of photographs of this balloon taken by amateurs and professionals alike, almost any would do for the purposes of the article. Wikinews claims that the balloon was low-flying and that photographs were captured by area residents.  The best way to get an image for the article would be to leave a placeholder in the article requesting that the public submit one. The effectiveness of such a place holder will probably diminish over time as the attention on this incident dies down. I've been checking flickr and other photo sites but have so far come up dry, though sometimes it takes a little while for people to bother uploading their photographs.I hope I haven't given the impression that I do not appropriate your contributions to the article— as I do, especially your efforts to use even and neutral language in the face of a media environment eager to describe the parties unfavourably. Thanks for your contributions!   "	0|0|0|0|0|0
" This is A Potentially Ridiculous Article Seriously, it is a potentially ridiculous article, and mislead readers to comprehend the word ""x86"", for the following reasons:1. Should sort AMD64 or Intel64 implementations as x86? Generally ""x86"" was used to point all the processors compatible with IA-32 ISA, might or might name themselves with ""86"", such as Cyrix 5x86, Intel Pentium 4 and so on. AMD64's long mode is devised by AMD rather than Intel, so how can one sort them together. Nowadays software labeled themselves as ""x86"" are IA-32 compatible software, and use ""x64"" or ""x86-64"" differentiating with it. So this article confuses reader getting in touch with this word. 2. Generations? What is the 8th generation x86 processor? Who invented this kinda processors? AMD K8 just says that it succeeds AMD K7 rather than saying it is the 8th x86 processor, and I've never heard Intel call their x86 processors exceeding the 7th generation. And one thing should never be denied, the first generation of Itanium processor says its family model number as 7, which might potentially imply that Itanium might be the 7th x86 processor succeeding Pentium III, but none confirmed this. So take turn back the Transmeta's Crusoe and Efficeon, if the morph firmed on the system board implements x86 decoder call themselves as x86 processors, then if put the same processor on another board implementing PowerPC decoder, then it would be the PowerPC processor? At this situation, what kind of processor is it? Ridiculous! What's more for what sort it as the 7th/8th generation x86? Who is another Jane Austen, making up another Northanger Abbey?3. ""x86"" is one architecture(ISA) name? What such a ridiculous thing that I've ever heard on earth! ""x86"" is used to referring the processor, a kind or series of processors rather than an architecture. If it were the name of an architecture, then in this logic way, Intel 80486 is one of the ""implementation"" of this ""architecture""?   "	0|0|0|0|0|0

Amcom article HiEarlier today I noticed that there is no article on Amcom, and I posted on the Amnet talk page, before moving it to talk:Amcom (because although the network is called Amnet, the actual company is called Amcom).I didn't realize until later that there was already an Amcom (actually Amnet) page that had been deleted. After reading the explanation for the deletion, I'm not sure whether Amcom really has enough notability or not. However, if we do want to make an Amcom page we will have to supply some secondary sources to justify the company's notability.If you are still interested, take a look at this article I found: If you want to reply to me, make sure you either reply on my talk page, or leave a note there saying that you have replied elsewhere.

When you look at it in the clear light of day, this is an argument in which both sides are doing the same things, and making the same (counter-)accusations. It has been 'resolved,' to date, by the fact that one side of the argument have the power. But might doesn't make right. Who actually started the unreasonable behaviour? Perhaps the Wikipedian who seemed to make the rather ambiguous statement in which he said that the (Holocaust) Talk page is not there for discussion. Well it is there for discussion - that's what a Talk page is. If he meant it is not there for irrelevant discussion he should have stated that explicitly, and, that having been done, be prepared to demonstrate that to anyone who might be in doubt on the matter.80.229.223.248	0|0|0|0|0|0

"This needs an additional citation for the first part ([2] only refers to him now being labelled a cheat). Henry has never been a fair footballer, the match has just brought to light the foul play he has ALWAYS used to get an upper hand (even the biased french and arsenal fans realise). Furthermore, the quote by Wenger that ""he is one of the fairest players I have managed"" holds no weight since:1) It is a biased view from a man who managed Henry for years.2) It is a view from a man who has managed a great number of cheating players during many years at Arsenal so saying Henry is one of the fairest isn't saying much.

"I support the idea of wikicode. Basically I think we should present code in a Python-like language that doesn't carry so much baggage. For example, we can use English sentences (or sentence fragments) instead of requiring the reader to understand some obscure Python library. (Further, Python has the baggage that there are no block-terminators: i.e., no ""}"" or ""end""s or ""fi""s or ""repeat""s. By adding such terminators, we can make it a lot less ambiguous to all readers.) In otherwords, we're basically right on track: removing the quirks of Python, and making it higher-level. So, I support the idea myself.  20:55, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)"	0|0|0|0|0|0

So, the sentence: ""On 1982-06-06 Israel invaded Lebanon in response to the attempted assassination of Israeli Ambassador Shlomo Argov by Abu Nidal in London on June 4.""should be expanded. This is a quickie list of basic facts: Israel had been bombing Lebanon/PLO for months, from the air, sea and land; and preparing for the invasion (see below, they couldn't have pulled of the invasion in a matter of days otherwise.) There was the attempted assassination Shlomo Argov ... The assassination attempt was used by Begin as an impetus to shortcut the Knesset's debate and move into Lebanon without full approval.

I am not sure if you are really understanding what I have been saying. We cannot put our own views or views of a leader of any party; or even base the party's ideology on them. I have been requesting you to read their manifestos from the very beginning. Any party will not run on a single leader's views or any newspaper views. If you find the CPN(M) and CPN(UML) identically same or if you find one party's inclination towards socialism and/or hardliner communism (in simple words- their political ideology and ultimately their position on the spectrum) same as the other in their manifestos, please let us all know. I will immediately withdraw my points. Let us not debate here, any single person who has read both manifestos would be crystal clear on the UCPN(M) and CPN(UML) as far as what their position is. Do not trust me but at least please go through their manifestos.Also, I have been watching many parties wiki pages of several countries across continents and all of them have their position stated. Why do you want to not keep it here? Ithink it makes it more clear with their position on  the spectrum. Thanks!38.114.81.204	0|0|0|0|0|0
"Speedy deletion of Jacob Silver A tag has been placed on Jacob Silver requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for biographies. If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the article (just below the existing speedy deletion or ""db"" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

(undent) This was previously discussed quite a bit at this talk page.  See Archive 9.  The consensus was that Hagee is covered adequately in John McCain presidential campaign, 2008. Hagee gets a couple paragraphs in that article.  The relationship (if one can call it that) between Hagee and McCain was much more remote and brief than that between Obama and Wright.  Many elections nowadays feature guilt-by-association games, but Obama-Wright-TUCC is a bit different, because the coverage went on so long during the campaign, and the relationship went on so long in real life.  If Hagee turns out to bedevil McCain as much as Wright and TUCC has affected Obama, it would merit inclusion here in this main McCain article.  There are hundreds of other items in the sub-articles also. Picking out just Hagee to add to this main article, and not picking out those other hundreds of items, would cause undue weight. This article is about McCain's whole life, not just the current campaign, and in the context of his whole life Hagee is just not very significant. If a person is scratching their head wondering the name of some minister connected with this election, then the person can go to the article about McCain's 2008 campaign (which has a couple paragraphs about Hagee). In writing this article, dozens of decisions were made about what the most important things in his life are, and those that aren't quite as important don't make the cut.  Right now, some of us think it would be more appropriate to add more about his Vietnam service before the shoot-down, or more on McCain-Feingold, or more on his relations with the Republican Party in the early 2000s, as compared to more about Hagee.	0|0|0|0|0|0

Animation There is something very unique about south park.Because of the style of animation, it is actually possible to have an episode of south park in an .svg animation, which is a file format that allows for unlimited up-conversion of images and animation but only in a way of simple shapes,and since south park is already a somewhat brick style animation, you could theoretically up-convert it to high definition using the .svg format and it would look just like that was the normal resolution.	0|0|0|0|0|0

"Alex, thank you for your reply.I could indeed use a break from this case, but yesterday was a very eventful day, as the case closed and then AGK answered a question I'd initially posed on August 22, meaning that he refused to engage regarding the false allegation he made against during the brief window during which I had a chance to respond to the FoF, and then when it made the response, it not only confirmed the ""judgment on content"" aspect of the FoF, if begs the question as to why he cited another diff including an exchange with Arzel in which Arzel not only ignores the content of academically published RS, he openly denigrates them in a thread where blocks of text of the Formisano text, for example, had been under direct discussion.Regarding the perceived legal threat, I had no intention to make a legal threat. That was all sort of sarcastic play on words relating to specific sequence of events in the case, starting with NewYorkBrad's comment on my FoF on August 23, to which AGK refused to reply publicly until the case had been closed yesterday, more than two weeks later. There were also email exchanges between myself and NYB and AGK, which I will have to forward to Jimbo Wales at some point, after clarifying one point made by NYB on his talk page.The import of the substance is firstly a pun insofar as I make an insinuation about sophistry in the legal field in relation to my perception that AGK aspires to become an attorney (or whatever they're called in Scotland). It is secondly an indication that I have taken the time to register at Wikipediocracy for future reference regarding earlier comments I had made about ""the court of public opinion"". And when did a little looking around there, finding an entry about NYB, for example, who had advised AGK that he didn't see any misconduct in some of the points of the FoF, so it was thirdly an indirect suggestion that he learn something from someone that is already an accomplished attorney. If the reiteration of material deleted by AGK from his User page within the past two weeks is ""outing"", then that is a policy I shall have to examine. Note that I am not the only editor to have broached the issue of his being an undergraduate in the context of his judgment and actions acting in the capacity of arbitrator in the case at issue.There's much more to say on this, but I need to get a couple more hours of sleep. I have tried to leave links to relevant discussions at Jimbo's talk page, but have only provided a partial synthesis of the situation, not even contrasting the complete lack of an FoF on Arzel, for instance, with the response provided to me on the PD talk page shortly after the case was officially closed yesterday.If this statement settles some of the concerns regarding my intentions, and the severity of the infractions thereby diminished, I would appreciate a reduction of the length of the block to facilitate my engaging in the necessary efforts to conduct the appeal without having to exclusively rely on the email system.  連絡 見学/迷惑 "	0|0|0|0|0|0
I found a better reference.In ,page 24, Theoretically, polygamy can assume any one of three possible forms: polygyny or the marriage of one man to two or more wives at a time, polyandry or the coexistent union of one woman with two or more men, and group marriage or a marital union embracing at once several men and several women.  Of these, only the first is common.And on page 25 A statistical analysis of Kaingang genealogies for a period of 100 years showed that 8 per cent of all recorded unions were group marriages, as compared with 14 per cent for polyandrous, 18 per cent for polygynous, and 60 per cent for monogamous unions.The disadvantage of working at a medical school is that the anthropology texts are not extensive, but they aren't checked out often either. This had been sitting on the shelf for over 20 years, deep in the recesses of the basement. Murdock is a sufficient reference for polygamy including group marriage.	0|0|0|0|0|0

MQM and their Abu Garib Style TerrorismI saw the debate between Imran Khan, Babar and Ajaz ul haq and I felt sorry for Imran Bhai that he was mistreated for his private life matters which was brought up as a more important matter than crimnal history of thug like Altaaf Hussain and his party who only tortures and kills whoever they wants. I have witnessed MQM and their Abu Garib style crimes. My cousin has worked for MQM and he told us that if he leaves the party he and his own family would be slaughtered. Entire Karachi has been suffering because of Altaaf Bhai of India who is getting Bhuttas in the form of water mafia and Karachi people do not have electricity and he is enjoying the cold breeze of London.

Said IT professional has to make some major changes to the MediaWiki system currently hosting WP. Changes would include but not be limited to:   a. BLPs must be heavily restricted and protected, or better yet, removed entirely.   b. A proper set of guidelines for editing and administration should be enacted AND ADHERED TO.       This would include limitations on the powers of all administrators, and requirements for editors to be      personally responsible for whatever they do on the wiki. No more IP-address editing. Anyone seeking      to write for WP must apply and be approved. NO PERSONS UNDER THE AGE OF 18. ""Assume good faith"" my ass.   c. ALL administrators must be elected by OPEN BALLOT, by the editors whose work they oversee.3. Most critical to the project's success: certain untrustworthy administrators MUST BE REMOVED and banned from WP PERMANENTLY.

If only Xeeron, you read the title ""SECURITY COUNCIL HOLDS THIRD EMERGENCY MEETING AS SOUTH OSSETIA CONFLICT INTENSIFIES, EXPANDS TO OTHER PARTS OF GEORGIA"" South Ossetia Conflict (War) expands, as in already expanded, it says expands, NOT expanding, or about to expand, therefore, the UN knowingly named the war the [2008] South Ossetia War, KNOWING that it will expand. See how important reading the title, and getting the correct title is? My arguments haven't evaporated anywhere; South Ossetia is still location-based (my initial argument); it is still where over 90% of the fighting took place; it still has the most important battle (Tskhinvali); my arguments are still here buddy. And Xeeron, I have pointed to you countless times that might doesn't make right. Saying the majority says so, does NOT make it NPOV. If you would have lived in the South during the Civil Rights Movenment you'd realize that might doesn't make right, or NPOV for that matter. I've seen your majority view point and called it a farce many times. Grey Fox - I have proof for how the ""2008 Georgia War"" is biased; it is biased because it IMPLIES that South Ossetia was a De Facto part of Georgia - which as we all know is bullshit, because if a region is De Facto and De Jure part of a country - there is no war! My Russian colleagues may disagree, but Chechnya was not De Facto part of Russia in the 1990's, it was De Jure. And it was called the Second Chechen War, not the Russian War 1999-2006. So in other words Mr. Grey Fox, and the other two of you, you have FAILED to show my how 2008 South Ossetia War is NPOV, but I HAVE shown you, and cited an example of how 2008 Georgia War would be incorrect and biased.

"Further edits have persisted adding ""citation needed"" tags to the lede: . Since the purpose of the lede is to summarise content in the body of the article (which should be sourced), WP:CITELEAD does require editors to add redundant citations i.e. if the claim or fact is already sourced in the article the citation does not need to be provided again in the lead. The first two sections of the article detail transcripts (in which Hitler proclaims himself to be vegetarian), diary entries and witness testimony from people very well acquainted with his diet confirming that he was almost certianly vegetarian from 1942 onwards. Sources detailing his diet prior to the war are a bit more inconsistent, indicating he may or may not have been vegetarian earlier in his life. Instead of repeatedly tagging the lead it would be helpful if the editor would at least explain their rationale for doing so; if they feel the sentence does not adequately summarise the sourced content in the article then would they please explain exactky what their problem is with it. Please note if a problem does indeed exist with the sentence, it is not that it is uncited it is that it does not neutrally and accurately summarize the claims our article makes.

"Kenneth Tennyson's reckless behavior in other forums==As far as Kenneth Tennyson bashing other authors, here is an exerpt from a book review on Amazon.com:Founder of the homemade Mushindo Karate movement, never studied under a legitimate teacher, or any martial art teacher, never set foot in Asia, completely disproven, shown to have plagiarized many photos and other materials from other published written sources. Of course he claims to have studied under masters in Tibet, and been a disciple of Okinawan Karate teachers - since disproven by such worthy sources as Gorge Mattson, et al. Was involved in an abusive sex scandal with several female students a few years back (""Sleep with me and I'll enlighten you"" kinda thing), uses abusive and coercive tactics to control what ex-students say at him, a propaganda liemaster. The person he is bashing is none other than Terrence Dukes (or the real Frank Dukes from the movie Bloodsport)While putting others down, Kenny brags, or advertises about his martial arts expertise to scare people:Hmmm... well, kalaripayattu has a lot of similarities with caopera, alot of jumping and posturing, and a lot of religious themes to it. I guess it depends on what martial arts you've trained in to determine whether I can kick A$$ or not. let's see... I'm a red belt second degree in tae kwon do and have some knowledge in shotoken. I've got to start learning about grappling though. Freedom skies and myself are not the only ones who feel that Kenny is a racist. Here are some excerpts from users from other forums:(The Armchair Analyst - Asia Times Forum)I see. However, you sounded like a racist.No, I have no ""South Asian sensitivities"". I am no nationalist/jingoist. I consider myself above it all. ALL your posts are based on the rather silly assumption that militaristic power in the last three centuries is a sign of ""greatness"". It may be in a narrow Anglo-saxon way, but not in a Gandhi-Buddha sort of a way. Get it?Civilizations such as India (actually even China until today) have NEVER had a negative impact on other civilizations that remotely matches yours.You have generalized Indians to be bigots etc., I agree that SOME not all are. But the fact that you generalized it to include an entire ethnic group as ""obnoxious"", by definition makes you a racist. YES IT DOES! (rocky - Asia Times Forum)What inaccuracy are you referring to? If Brits came to India and got rich, was the wealth Indian or British? Besides looting, what exactly did British accomplish? While your bias is clearly visible with this statement, what is your purpose of posting this in this forum?Isnt it quiet evident that even in yr 2005, it is difficult for you to get off your pompus ass, why on earth would anything written by Anglo-Saxon when Europeans were busy colonizing the world accurate? Isnt there a vested interest on part of the European to disparage Native Cultures and delibrately belittle their achievements? That's just a couple of the many others. However, I do not want to clog up this page.I have also noticed that Kenny tends to have a habit of cutting and pasting articles, and also cloning the article he had fabricated on a few web sites  I know that I am not the only one who knows this:'(Brahman - Martial Arts Planet Forum)i really do hate to post on this topic seems as it was only to counter mine, which by the way it would be nice if you would simply post this on my topic were you could get a real discusion, were as here people might simply ignore you becuase of the topic cloning.

"Hmmm. I was actually writing a response as you sent yours. Oh well. For the record, my response was this:Resurrecting articles is frowned upon, yes. We might be able to get away with it if the article we resurrect is a substantial improvement on the last one, however - though of course we both know that there's no guarantee it would ultimately be accepted whatever we did - there is an established bias towards deleting articles on individual matches. Changing the name would be nice but I'm not sure what we would change to...the game didn't really have a ""name"" like the Ballet on Ice or any such, and there are limited other ways of naming the article.Making this subpage was a decent idea, you just got unlucky in that it's something that has already been tried elsewhere and ultimately voted against. Honestly I can say I've never seen a subpage for an actual mainspace article so I have no idea how much people tend to chase these articles up or whether it might just glean a community-wide shrugging of the shoulders. Certainly there's been no AfD nomination yet, which is a start. I have to say I somewhat favour making it a standalone article or merging with the season article (i.e. not keeping the subpage) but I don't have strong feelings so I'll run with whatever works. If it got categorised it would either be put into a category for something like Category:Football matches (I have no idea if that exists, it was another example) and Category:FA Cup and then probably into a new category for City matches or comebacks or somesuch where it probably would be on its own. That category would then have to be categorised so it wasn't just an orphan. I don't know what the ethic is here for creating categories with only a single article in them but I suspect it's not encouraged, so that idea might be rejected if (whoever did it) couldn't find more like-minded articles to categorise into the same. I don't think it being categorised would really affect anyone's opinion of the article though. The one thing that might affect peoples' judgement right now is that it will (in its present form) show up in categories as ""2003–04 Manchester City F.C. season/Spurs 3-4 City"" or however the subpage is actually named, given the / in the name.Yes, I'd say it will currently be located in an overarching ""please categorise these pages"" category. I don't know how long it would take for it to get sorted, but it would probably be put somewhere generic. Better to do it ourselves, I guess.Sorry my thoughts were a bit disjointed but I was answering the points as they came and...well, better English just didn't quite flow from my fingers as I typed. Hopefully I addressed all your points. I'll settle for just keeping the subpage if you want it, though I think that page would be best served by being redone - with as many citations as possible - and expanded upon, so we can argue a case for it being reincluded into society, so to speak. Having an article AfD'ed isn't a permanent sign that that article should never exist, it's merely a suggestion that it shouldn't exist in the state it's in. Generally speaking most articles that get deleted will be kept the second time around if their quality and/or level of detail is substantially improved.As for the Charity Shield, I always considered it a notable trophy. Yes, it's a single game, but it requires winning a trophy to qualify in the first place (ignoring those early years when some teams refused to play). To this end, I'd consider it more of an accomplishment than winning the trophy which qualified you for it. Similarly, would you question the worthiness of the European Super Cup? In fact, because some teams initially didn't enter, City were instrumental in making the Charity Shield the respected competition it is today by taking their place in the competition twice. You could argue that of all the teams to have ever played in it, we should be the ones most ardently defending it.  Talk "	0|0|0|0|0|0

Unfortunately, because the logos are usually housed on Wikicommons and there are jurisdictions that they server that do not have the same copyright laws, they feel it's OK to have logos and crests on kits. That's why they show-up here.

Being an editorial opinion does not disqualify it per se, but taking account the fact that this is an article about the worldwide company with more than 100-years history, this opinion about one specific aspect related to the company, voiced by non-mainstream magazine, will have undue weight.

Gibraltar HistoryGibraltar has a long history and the failed Spanish attempt to 'reclaim' the territory forms a small part of its modern history.  Anyone who doubts that the Gibraltarians reject the claim or any proposal of joint sovereignty should read the section on the 2002 referendum.As regards claims that terrorists were 'murdered' here, the Gibraltar constitution defines what murder is, and the inquiry held in Gibraltar determined that it was lawful killing. Visitors intending travelling with bombs should note that part of the constitution is still in place.	0|0|0|0|0|0

Country related content moved, no changes to content User Noclador made some good faith edits, moving several pieces of US/Libya relations content from other sections (Europe) with the intent of having it in a US section. He created a new USA section. However, there was an existing United States section (he/she must just have not seen it). I deleted his new USA section, and moved the content to the existing United States section. One of the items was about a NY Times article Gadaffi wrote. While it was a US paper, the content was about Israel and Palestine, not the US (it just happened to be in a US publication). I moved that content to the Israel section.So long story short, no content change other than location, and everything should be in its proper place.	0|0|0|0|0|0

(Not more than many other events and aspects concerning the Beatles.)  Nor is the interpretation in question in any way obscure, since it can be taken from any number of texts on the Beatles.  However, though I support the original author's intent here, I guess you and I are going to have to agree to disagree over this point for now.  At some point, however, I will source his/her statements  as soon as I find time to delve into the texts  just because I would appreciate reaching some sort of accord with you.  Until then, I don't think we will make much more progress on this. [The problem with something like this is that there is no absolute truth.  But to me, discrediting the original author's intent is like a dog biting its own tail.  From wikipedia: re. Abbey Road being the final album or not:Abbey Road is the eleventh official album recorded by The Beatles. Although its release preceded that of Let It Be, it was the last album to be recorded. ...After the near-disastrous sessions for the proposed Get Back album (later retitled Let It Be for release), Paul McCartney suggested to producer George Martin that the group get together and make an album ""just like the old days. .. just like we used to,"" free of the conflict that began with the sessions for The White Album. Martin agreed to this if the band would be ""the way they used to be."" In their interviews for the Beatles Anthology series, the surviving band members stated they knew at the time this would very likely be the final Beatles' product, and therefore they agreed to set aside their differences and ""go out on a high note.""re. the position of ""The End"":""The End"" was initially intended to be the final track on Abbey Road, but it is followed by ""Her Majesty"". In the first practice mix of the medley, constructed on 30 July, ""Her Majesty"" followed ""Mean Mr. Mustard""......etc.  This labyrinth has already been walked through a thousand times by a thousand people.] 09:58"	0|0|0|0|0|0
Did you know that out of 10 million people, all of them said that both Dylan and Cole Sprouse are gay. The funny thing is that all the people asked found they are both equally gay.

POV forkingI combined POV fork paragraphs in the article per WP:POVFORK.  I also organized redundant references for sake of not deleting them but they will need to be culled.  There's a lot of primary sources and original research in the citations that need to be removed.The POV forks dealt with are:1. Korean vs Japanese origin of TKD.  This POV fork existed in the opening of history section and the modern developments section.2. Historical context behind Japanese ban of Korean MA.  POV fork existed in opening paragraph of modern development section and then again in the third paragraph.  The third paragraph also contained editor personal comments and ruminations which is considered original research WP:OR.	0|0|0|0|0|0
"At bat; Edit Warring at Matt Joyce (baseball), Juan Encarnación, Terry Tiffee, Ian Kinsler, Craig Breslow, Matt Guerrier, etc.==Please don't change ""At bat"" to ""at-bat"". ""At-bat"" just redirects right back to at bat anyway. -  I agree.  I agree because he is correct that it should not be hyphenated.  In addition, pls stop edit warring at Matt Joyce (baseball), Ian Kinsler, Craig Breslow, etc.  And add to the list Matt Guerrier.  It is perfectly accurate and reasonable to reflect his won lost record.  There is no reason to delete it, other than your penchant for disruptive edits.  Kindly desist.  It has also been explained to you, with proper citations, that the plural of RBI is RBIs.  Pls stop edit warring this point.  See Juan Encarnación and Terry Tiffee.  That is vandalism.  Run batted in says: ""The term may be pluralized as either RBI or RBIs"". Obviously not vandalism then but a difference in opinion then.@Matt Guerrier, the reason it didn't show up was because a ""|"" was missing, and with your edit you re-removed it and duplicated info.It's amazing how you continue to assume bad faith, blindly reverting and editwarring over messages on his own talk page...  (t / c) Danged if this little war isn't over some seriously picayune crap. Both sides are being a bit petty here, because really either set of edits is acceptable on these pages (well, except for the bolded Contract on Ian Kinsler  either make it a subhed or take it off, seriously).Oh, and technically, the plural of RBI is RsBI, but that just looks clunky. In common usage, ""RBI"" is used for either singular ""Run Batted In"" or plural ""Runs Batted In"". ""RBIs"" is a bastardization used only because it's simpler from a usage standpoint.Either way, I think everyone involved in this should chill out for a few days and just leave all these pages alone. -  Jackal4, again, is making a rash of these edits on every page I touch.  As to RBIs, as X96lee15 pointed out the most thorough treatment is at Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Baseball/Archive_5#RBIs.  Plus, mlb.com is the official reporter of baseball, and uses the RBIs convention.  Yet, Jackal4's reaction to that is to go on pages where I have written it thus, to delete the s  as though the s is incorrect.  He has done the same with ""at bat""  which he insists must be hyphenated.  Etcetera .... these are just two of the types of reverts he feels impelled to make of my edits.  It is picayune, but it is wrong to revert perfectly good edits.  If he insisted on lower-casing RBIs, or any similar degradation, I would think it wrong of him to follow people around and revert perfectly good edits.  There is enough good work he could perform instead.   Well, I can't stop him from wasting time if that's what he wants to do ) . As for ""thorough treatment"", I'm not sure I consider a bit to which a grand total of two people contributed particularly thorough. I respect Kingturtle, but I think he's got it wrong on this one. Regarding what mlb.com uses, you're appealing to the wrong authority, because it's not a terminology issue, it's a grammar issue. In any case, at this point I have no doubt that these edits are being reverted simply because you're both watching for each other's names on your watchlists. Allow me to again encourage the both of you to just stay away from each other's edits entirely for a while and allow the bad feelings to ebb. At the rate you're going, you're both going to get blocked. -  Jargon overrides grammar. To say that a batter ""flied out"" is probably not good grammar either, but it's proper baseball terminology. I think this needs to be discussed at the project page, assuming anyone's watching that page anymore. [[User:Baseball	0|0|0|0|0|0

" Legislation: European Union  The atricle claims: ""The European Union has ratified a law ""banning incitement to or denial of genocide"" (both the Holocaust and the Armenian Genocide)."" The source reads: ""The European Union has just ratified a law “banning incitement to or denial of genocide” (arguably including both the Holocaust and the Armenian genocide)."" Some enthusiasts removed the word arguably when citing the source.  Let's have a look at the law itself.  Framework decision on combating racism and xenophobia Official Press Release Certain forms of conduct as outlined below, which are committed for a racist or xenophobic purpose, are punishable as criminal offences: ... public condoning, denying or grossly trivialising crimes of genocide ... as defined in the Statute of the International Criminal Court (Articles 6, 7 and 8) and crimes defined in Article 6 of the Charter of the International Military Tribunal, when the conduct is carried out in a manner likely to incite violence or hatred against such a group or a member of such a group. Example: Somebody publicly claims that an act of genocide, the commission of which has been established as a fact by an international court, never happened and was invented by the ethnic group concerned solely for the purpose of being able to claim compensation payments. This allegation would not only deny the genocide committed against the ethnic group concerned, but would also incite hatred against this group. In the future, all Member States would be compelled to criminalise such a case. Whether a specific historical crime falls within these definitions must be decided in each concrete case by the court which has jurisdiction. In the case of the Holocaust, for example, this was done by the Nuremberg Tribunal. As we see, the law is restricted to cases, when: the commission of genocide is established by an international court and the denial is carried out in a manner likely to incite violence or hatredIs the commission of Armenian genocide established by an international court?

It isn't. Both aren't even theories, but products of simpleton invention without basis and are completely undoubtedly incorrect. I favor none. I delete(d) them both, because AFAIK there are none sources at all on this issue. The House of Saint Vladimir is of descent from a Travunian local noble house, with doubtable links to the House of Trpimirovic and most surely no link to the House of Viseslavic. However, I must object putting it as a separate line - Tvrtko asserted rule and his line (Tvrtkovic) is historically considered the main line of the Kotromanics. As for the Trpimirovic branches, I suggest following standard historical interpretation of the Svetoslavic being a cadet branch, whereas the other being the simple continuation of the standard Trpimirovic line (Kresimirovic)?	0|0|0|0|0|0

Backing 9 of the horses with a stake of GBP10 each in order to lay the remaining horse results in a loss of GBP20 no matter which horse wins.    05:10, 31 Mar 2005 (UTC)	0|0|0|0|0|0

Negatively biased articleThe following was entered into the article text in these edits by 139.182.118.81 (  ):'Whomever wrote this wikipedia information, has a clear bias and is absolutely against Dr. Albert Rivera. In this biograpgy he is promptly attacked as a fraud before and after stating the life of Dr. Alberto. The refrences of public magazines where Dr. Rivera is pointed as a fraud are commentary, opinionated and are not mere fact. It is clear that Dr. Rivera's life is quite controversial and to discredit him is the easiet form to invalidate his claims. Out of evident knowledge, Dr. Alberto was not Anti-Catholic, he only spoke what he lived. It would be quite contradicting to have been not only a Roman Catholic, but a Jesuite and then be margined as Anti-Catholic. Obviously this would be the best label in order for Catholics to reject and discard whatever Dr. Rivera has said.	0|0|0|0|0|0

I was assaulted and battered by students T and I and possibly other students at Markham Middle School, 145 W 108th Street, Los Angeles.  The Police Report is DR#071828895.LAUSD personnel, specifically, Steven Thomas Rooney, aided and abetted violations of the Ralph and Bane Civil Rights Acts, Sections 51.7, 52 and 52.1 of the California Civil Code and Sections 242, 245, and 422.6 of the California Penal Code, by failing and refusing to report the matter to police authorities.  LAUSD violated my rights under Article I, Section One of the California Constitution to safety and my specific right to safety on a school campus under Article I, Section 28 of the California Constitution.  I have suffered physical damages and extreme emotional trauma as a result.David Brewer and other personnel knew or should have known based upon my complaints and upon past known misconduct by Rooney that Rooney was unfit as a supervisory employee of LAUSD.  LAUSD therefore negligently hired, trained, assigned, supervised and retained Rooney and ignored my complaints about his misconduct.LAUSD’s conduct towards me is motivated by benign neglect of complaints of discrimination, retaliation, and harassment by Latino employees, as exemplified in past incidents by Superintendent Brewer and the General Counsel’s office failing to properly investigate and take appropriate action when complaints were levelled against anti-Hispanic ethnocentric misconduct against an attorney employed by the Office of the General Counsel, and other incidents.Pursuant to Section 910(f) this claim is for damages within the jurisdiction of the unlimited division of the Los Angeles Superior Court.Respectfully Submitted,Migdia Chineacc:  California LULAC Civil Rights Commission, United For Education Coalition	0|0|0|0|0|0

Peer Reviews Happy New Year, Wack'd!  Since you've assessed quite a few good articles and contributed to them, I thought I could solicit your assistance.  I've submitted two articles for peer review, and thought that you might be of some help in critiquing them:Duck Soup. I've listed this article for peer review because, even though I and other editors have contributed much information and references, I'm certain that there are other aspects of this classic film that have yet to be covered. I'd like to hear feedback from you, so that I can get help in improving this (and other Marx Brothers films) quality.Princess Leia Organa. I've listed this article for peer review because it right now seems oddly cluttered and, despite a lot of references as of now, lacks reliable source citations.  Although I've already requested another peer review, as long as it helps the articles get better, I've got the time. Any helpful comments will certainly be appreciated, as this should help me in expanding other Star Wars-centric articles.If you have the time, it'd be great if you could review those articles and assess their strengths and weaknesses.

MATIA, I have told you a hundred times that articles on dialects do NOT have the word language in the title. Witness Brigish English, Mandarin (linguistics), Flemish (linguistics), Ashkenazi Hebrew, Cantonese (linguistics), American English, Sephardi Hebrew, etc etc... Arvanitic is a dialect according to all our sources as interpreted by Wikipedia policy, therefore Arvanitic language or Arvanitika language are out of the question. I don't want to use Arvanitika Albanian as it will be too controversial (so i don't want Albanian in the title). Therefore, the only options are Arvanitic or Arvanitika. They can and should be used. Arvanitic has the majority vote, and therefore that shall be used. What is wrong with it? It is neutral. It does not prescribe that Arvanitic is a language or a dialect and as it has been pointed out, the reader can review all the evidence for himself/herself and see what he/she thinks. Wikipedia should not take sides and especially Wikipedia should not say that UNESCO, Britannica etc aree wrong. Macedonian and Luxembourgish etc CAN be treated as languages because all neutral credible sources say they are (while the same sources say that Arvanitic is a dialect). If Britannica or UNESCO etc said that they were dialects, then they could be treated as such. No neutral source formally aknowledges that they are dialects. Why should they be treated as such. Every neutral source says that Arvanitic is a dialect and therefore should be treated as such and the word language should not be in the title. We can discuss possibilities of it being a language in the text, but NOT in the title. Arvanitic is neutral and will be used as it has received he majority support. Possibilities of Arvanitic being a language in its own right can be discussed in the article, NOT in the title as that would be a violation of Wikipedia's policies. What UNESCO, Britannica etc say is assumed correct according to WP:V and WP:NOR. I am not labeling Arvanites Albanians against their will. Are we labeling the Irish English against their will by calling their language (Hiberno English) a dialect of English? No! So stop that straw man argument. Arvanitic is neutral and will not offend anyone AND has majority support here and will be used according to policy. The world is not made to please you, neither is Wikipedia. We have policies that must be observed, so if you want to use Wikipedia, you will just have to accept them. Regards   (PS does peace mean having to violate WP policies? That is what you are asking me to do)	0|0|0|0|0|0

" (UTC)As a close follower of the language-political issues in Finland, I have always disliked this intentional fudging of mother tongue's significance in defining what, if you will, we could call ""ethnic identity"" especially when it comes to Finnish-speakers. Swedish-speakers have identified themselves very clearly as essentially an ethnic group all the way until the latter half of last century, when it became much more politically convenient to start pushing the idea of the entire people having ""two languages"", which from individual people's mother-tongue point of view is patent nonsense  the mother tongue of, say, my entire family tree is Finnish and what Swedish they speak has been taught to them at school as essentially foreign language. Whatever happens in the future, our language policy has not yet managed to implant Swedish as a general second language in the population, and this must be taken into account here. I can well understand how Fenno-Swedes can identify as some sort of particular subgroup and still be considered ""Finnish"", but there is always the flipside of such a coin.   13:39, 21 August 2009"	0|0|0|0|0|0

In the layouts that were originally written for the Taipei Metro and Guangzhou Metro, the terminal was placed before the next stop, so I had based the NYC-area railroad layouts on the Taipei/Guangzhou layouts.

"Hello Deacon, thanks for the kind words. Your wording is better regarding territory, but I think that it still might specifically mention the Firth of Clyde, since Northumbria ruled the area south of it for a while ... how about ""between the Humber and the Firths of Clyde and Forth"", or similar? But there's no great preference here either way.Oswiu chose the Roman way at Whitby in 664, and he died in 670; thereafter there was a steady erosion of Iona-based clerics in Northumbrian territory, quite noticeable by Pehthelm's consecration in the 8th century ... have a look at the Skene reference I cite, which suggests that both Picts and Northumbrians were working in concert in the early 8th century towards the Roman way in preference to the Columban way.It looks like a political process, constant and steady, but not a sudden, forcible ouster ... the end result was indeed a facilitation of Northumbrian hegemony. Northumbria's fortunes were up-and-down in the 7th century regarding its southern neighbors, particularly Mercia, and that is not to suggest that anyone chose Deiran preferences over Bernician ones. I'm aware of the substantial history of Iona-based clerics in Bernicia, but times change (and sometimes political entities do things for expedient reasons).The translation of Pehthelm's name without stated authority is indeed sourced ... the claim is made flat-out, so have a look at the reference cited; I tried to make sure that anyone who likes to check out references can do so easily ... indeed, you should be able to quickly access every citation that I made in the article.

" Deletion of Dave Warwak page Wondering why is was necessary to delete the page on Dave Warwak, an educator of vegan practices and animal rights. I see that your comment on the reason for deletion was ""the only thing he is known for is being fired"" however that is not the case in the animal friendly, vegetarian, vegan community. In fact he is praised by many for his passion in properly educating children about the origins of their food. Why would you find it so crucial to ""speedy"" delete a page that simply speaks of CRUELTY FREE living, and aims to educate people on the truth about their ""food""? Is that information threatening to Wikipedia for some reason? And I wouldn't think as a wiki admin that your OPINION on the topic is reason enough to control what info is available and what is deleted. YOU may know Mr. Warwak as only being fired, but being the intelligent science studying individual that you are, surly you must realize that his efforts to educate children and promote compassion for animals is actually very honorable and deserving of recognition.

Troublesome sentencePaleolithic Europeans seem to have been a homogenous population, possibly due to a population bottleneck (or near-extinction event) on the Iberian peninsula, where a small human population is thought to have survived the glaciation, and then expanded into Europe during the Mesolithic periodThis is false. I cannot recall any study which asserts confidently that Palaeolithic Europe was genetically homogeneous. If there is one, it would require in-line citation. I think whoever wrote the sentence has confused themselves. The studies have, rather, shown that Mesolithic Europe became more homogenepus because of population bottlenecking with subsequent expansion. The bottlenecking did not cause a homogeneous Palaeolithic population becuase the events occurred subsequently.	0|0|0|0|0|0

You have some ideas of what is the pov of opponents to some Israeli policies but when you write an article on such a topic, it is not enough to google for some articles about what they say. You have to understand their arguments as well as you understand those that you share/listen day-to-day and put all of them in article in order that everybody understand them. You also have to introduce their arguments ""fairly"" so that they can be understood.The big issue [for you] will be that on the statistical point of view, you should face 50% of time arguments from the other side partly stronger than the ones you believe in.

STARBLIND and HYPER-INDIVIDUALIST @YAHOO.COM ARE PART OF THE HOAX!A geneologist expert has been brought in to verify the previous article. Several of the points have already been proven with verifiable facts and evidence. Yet, when those point are made evidently clear both starbling and Hyper-individualist@Yahoo.com continue to ignore it and chose not to respond. The true hoax on this Barbaro family page is that these two individuals are trying to ignore verifiable evidence and have set out to destroy good knowledge for everyone- verifiable knowledge. Starblind has decided to put what ever he wants on the page but can not provide a single source of evidence to validate his selection. These two hoaxers have only one desire, but to detroy good validated information for the public and to extend turmoil. These two hoaxers continually make attempts to stop progress and provide no real solutions for Wikipedia problems . I suggest that Starblind be removed from Wikipedia editing.

I understand your difficulty. I am able to read some other language Wikis, but I can not write an article for them. On a different page,  explained that a stamp article about Azerbaijan was deleted about a year ago. I do not know what happened there exactly. Do you know that there is a Wiki site where people can request translations Wikipedia articles from other languages into English? If the article ru:Почтовые марки и история почты Азербайджана is exactly what the English Wiki article is supposed to contain, perhaps you could ask there for someone to translate it. There is a small form to fill out there. I can even do that for you, if you tell me the article is exactly what is needed here. I can not promise that anyone will translate it, but we can ask.

Several alternate titles (""Sources"", ""Citations"", ""Bibliography"") may also be used, although each is problematic: ""Sources"" may be confused with source code in computer related articles; ""Citations"" may be confused with official awards or a summons to court; ""Bibliography"" may be confused with a list of printed works by the subject of a biography.

" European Borders There is a BIG problem going on about whether Republic of Georgia and other neighboring countries should be included in Europe or not .As you know there is no official border between europe and Asia and there is a great number of unofficial versions .so you might think that it is LOGICAL to explain all of the versions that exist for today on that page..........      well sadly thats not what most editors think. they put one version there and every time I changed it, it went back to the previous version. now I am just wondering do these people think it is their personal page or what gives them the right to rely on several sources and ignore other ones that are not any less trust me. They should definately offer every version of where the border goes between the two continents instead of putting only one version  and not even bothering to explain why, it is unacceptable. I contacted one of the editors and he/she said that he chose that version because he/she ""thinks it is the most neutral one"". I am sorry but what some users ""think"" should be completely irrelevant while making an article on the website which has an ambition to be Credible. they should include all of the versions or not include anything at all before there is an OFFICIAL border ! Council of Europe, the oldest organization in europe classifies country as european,  country is in the middle of the NATO membership process (only european countries are eligible for it according  to the North Atlantic Treaty) and they are not even mentioning why they left it out. Turkey is not the case because it was already amember of nato. cant they understand that page is not about the EU. its the entire europe as a whole and until the borders will be determined OFFICIALLY all of the versions should be included.

"A poor start, sorry. The author seems to be totally mislead about both real history and the opinions on the table. First of all, no common two-nations table is possible (patent nonsense). Second, I object the following:the passage from the Russian table speaking of the Kievan Rus. As someone suggested earlier, that table should by any mean include a disclaimer explaining very loose ancestry between Kievan Rus and modern Russia. This is the main disputed claim (commented enough in other articles), unacceptable for me and several other Ukrainian and Belarusian usersRegardless of any ""Ukrainian military"" table, none of them may include the Red Army. This army was not only irrelevant to any of Ukrainian states (with very formal post-WWII exception), but also significantly anti-Ukrainian. For instance, Red Army units widely participated in war crimes against Ukrainian population and anti-Soviet guerillas. Creation of the ""Ukrainian"" table here has been a mere discussion trick not supported by all Ukrainian users. For instance, see earlier AlexPU's passage on ""trading the truth""Given all that, I'd suggest you to delete your first draft and find other ways for compromising.

I fully agree with recommending the image for deletion, especially in light of the dubious claims as to its authenticity.  While his hair does have some natural wave, it is nowhere near that long or curlyto say nothing of the clear differences in face shape, length, width, and symmetry. Some of the first image results on a Google search are T.R. with longer/wavy hair, and there is no resemblance to the individual in the picture being debated.  In terms of specific detailsyou've claimed this is a recent picture from T.R.'s breaka date that the picture was taken would be a good start.	0|0|0|0|0|0

" More description of location please? Hello, I wondered if someone with the requisite local knowledge would please consider adding a short sentence, maybe in the description section, to explain where this bridge is? I do appreciate that its location is already described in the lead as crossing between things X and Y but if you don't already know Stockton well (or recently!) this is not necessarily all that helpful. I was wondering if you could write a more bottom-up description which says something like ""the bridge crosses the Tees at blah (or near Blah Street etc); it is A hundred metres downstream from the Foo Bridge and B hundred metres upstream from the Bar Barrage"" or whatever, which it seems to me would nail it in more empirical terms. What do you think? Any yes, of course the maps link does nail it (assuming the co-ordinates are right!) but something in the text which helps in this way would, I think, be very useful. I may be being unusually thick  (happens all the time, actually) but on my first reading - and I was last in Stockton in 2007, you see - I was not at all sure where it was, wondering if in fact it replaced the other rather nice pedestrian bridge closer to the town centre. I cured this uncertainty by looking at the maps, yes, but the sentence I'm asking for would have given me more direct access to the knowledeg. Go on, please write it for me, you know you want to; and I will go and put the kettle on for you. Thanks and best wishes   "	0|0|0|0|0|0

Automatic protection for Main Page? It would be straightforward to write a bot that (1) protected all images on the main page, adding Template:Mprotected, and (2) unprotected all images with Template:Mprotected that no longer appeared on the main page. Feature (2) would be genuinely useful and save editors work. However, if editors came to rely on feature (1) then that would introduce a risk, because there would always be a gap between an image appearing on the main page and the bot protecting it. A clever vandal could vandalize the image in that gap. And worse, the bot would end up protecting the vandalized version of the image. I suppose the bot could attempt to detect vandalism like that but you can see how complex the process could become.  08:13, 2005 May 13 (UTC)	0|0|0|0|0|0

"Changes to this Page - Open discussion ==Since my first contribution over two months ago, I have been trying my best to make known my views on what improvements could be made to this page. After an initial consultation with an administrator I decided to ""be bold"" and start a ""démenagement"" of all that had nothing to do with the city of Paris. I was met with opposition over a link - and after being complained about I thought it best to put things back the way they were until I could get a good feel of the ""general concensus"" of the page's contibutors. I have seen little concensus but a lot of silent stalling.My goal here is not to ""control"" anything, as was complained to one of the administrators - I would like only to contribute to making a better page. I have learned much from other Paris pages and pages concerning French history - namely those concerning the French kings - but those are well covered as far as knowledgable contributors are concerned and are in little need of improvement, so I had little to do there. This page, on the other hand, I find lacking, and see many things that could be improved.The most important fault this page has is its quantity of specialised information - far too much for a general ""Paris"" page. The search function is a very important element of Wikipedia, and with this in mind, much on this page is redundant and unneccessary. Those looking for ""Paris economy"" will type exactly that into the search window. The same for ""Paris history"" or ""paris fashion"". Here I am but repeating what I have already written below.In short, in order to make this page a comprehensible tool for one looking for a lead from the subject of Paris, or one totally ignorant on the subject  - in other words, one who knows only enough to type only ""Paris"" into the search window - I propose to move the more ""specialty"" information to their own pages. My apologies to those who have contributed the more detailed information, but this would be better suited to a ""specialty"" page of its own. This would even be a positive move, as it would allow the contributor knowledgable in the subject of his contribution to expand his input far beyond what could be contained on this one page.The irony of the sort is that, though I contribute to Wiki, it won't be to this page in any quantity. My specialty is the history of Paris, and I cannot even think to add that knowledge here - Paris' history has a page of its own. Just to give you all a clear idea of where my aims are.Here I would like to contribute in the interest of clear information. I hope with this post to create an opportunity for improvement - please answer with any ideas you would have. With this post I would also like to ""sound the board"" - to see whether it is an interest for information or partisanship that holds the upper hand on this page, as what I have seen to date leaves room for doubt. In your answers, I hope for evidence to the contrary. Please feel free to forward any thoughts on the matter at all.

The article needs protecting and only updateable by official christian death facts.  People that want information about any past members will have to have pages dedicated to them.  But the article should be adhered to as much as facts allow.  3rd party discussion regarding Valor or Rozz should be eliminated in favour of the Christian Death Biography.message me at myspace.com/Official_Christian_Death to have discussion about page.ARTICLE I PROPOSE IS THUS: text only-  I will alter the page to format correctly, and alter the main page,   add feedback to this AFTER MY DISCUSSION in thread called - Editing Talk:Christian Death® (comment), not inside this.CHRISTIAN DEATHBIOGRAPHY&Discography  In the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth. Then Christian Death turned it upside down.HistoryOfficially there have been over 30 musicians involved with the band. Therefore a historical litany of them all would be impractical.Formed in Los Angeles and fronted by 16 year old vocalist/lyricist Rozz Williams, the band released the first album “Only Theatre Of Pain in 1982. A dark, sinister style of punk rock. The album gained local success. A year later the band completely broke upSinger Rozz then joined the band “Pompeii 99' founded by singer, guitarist, song writer Valor.Rozz took over vocals leaving Valor to focus on guitar. Before Rozz joined Pompeii 99, the band had already released their fist album “Look At Yourself” to much acclaim, which had an apocalyptic theme with a punk rock flavor. The Pompeii 99 had been planning their first tour when it was proposed by their French record company, to merge Pompeii 99 into a new version of Christian Death which after some debate was agreed upon. Thus, began the new Christian Death and the first Pompeii 99 tour became the first Christian Death tour.Part way through the tour the band stopped in Wales to record songs, some of which were originally intended for the next Pompeii 99 album. The fusion of which led to the unique sound of the classic “Catastrophe   Ballet”.Like the first Pompeii 99 album, Catastrophe Ballet had an apocalyptic theme, however the music morphed into something not quite Pompeii 99 and nothing like the first Christian Death album. After the tour the band returned to LA to later record the 3rd Christian Death album”Ashes”which was a post apocalyptic vision of a cold and bleak future. After confirming the 2nd tour in 85 singer Rozz quit the band. Valor returned to vocals, the band embarked on the 2nd tour. In Italy the band recorded the mini album “The Wind Kissed Pictures”, a surrealist view of a mystical past. Almost immediately work began on the 4th full length album “Atrocities” inspired by the atrocities of World War II and the connection to future shock waves. While continuously touring in 87 the band released the 5th and now classic album “The Scriptures”, the theme of which explored world religion and how the legacy of these beliefs impact our world today.1988 Brought us the release of “Sex & Drugs & Jesus Christ”. This was turning point for the band. The cover depicted an image of Jesus shooting up heroin. This was a full frontal attack by Valor against the Church with a scathing heretical mockery of organized Christianity. The band then found themselves confronted by protesters, riots and bomb threats, These events and the bands imagery and fashion went on to influence the likes of Nine Inch Nails, Korn, Marilyn Manson, Type O Negative, every Goth band on the planet and many others.1989 saw the release of the double album epic “All the Love, All the Hate” interpreting the juxtaposition between life and death, day and night, man and woman, black and white.In 1991 came the release of “Insanus, Ultio, proditio, Misericordiaque”, with its theme of an ancient dream state.Late in 91, after being in several other bands and seven years after quitting Christian Death, Rozz was persuaded by unscrupulous profiteers to perform at a concert in Los Angels under the name Christian Death. On the same day Christian Death was in Europe performing in Paris, France. Assuming this was a one time effort to earn extra cash, as explained to Valor	0|0|0|0|0|0

Notability of Ambridge country clubA tag has been placed on Ambridge country club, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article seems to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in Wikipedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert notability may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, and if you can indicate why the subject of this article is notable, you may contest the tagging. To do this, add  on the top of the page (below the existing db tag) and leave a note on the article's talk page explaining your position. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm its subject's notability under the guidelines.For guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria for biographies, for web sites, for bands, or for companies.

The very long discussion over st WP:SCN project talk page I have read a lot of the WP:SCN pages, and the very few have Neutrality tags. Some have OR tags but the majority seem to be NPOV. So why is the project talk page being bloated by a discussion between three Scientologists (from what I can make out have scanned all three user pages, and a lot of comments are unsigned) about how the project is biased against Elron? Would the time not be better used by going through the pages and challenging NPOV, possibly by throwing in neutrality tags and pointing out non-NPOV statements on the talk pages of those articles? After all Xenu is FA status so the NPOV cannot be too far off. As for unsigned, the comment you left after my first post was unsigned, and there were a couple of more during the discussion.	0|0|0|0|0|0

"Nor have I made a legal threat.  First, I am not among those three people who participated in that visit to the BLM protest.  I have never known any of these people.  I would not be the offended party, in any case.  I've never even lived in Minnesota, or been there in over 30 years or so.  (I made an airplane connection through Minneapolis in about 1985, as I vaguely recall.)  I am not saying there WILL be any sort of legal proceeding; I am merely saying that to cite this claim (""heard the N-word"") risks running afoul of being libel.  I think WP rules allow us to express concern that the cite of a vague assertion that somebody ""heard the N-word"" is problematic from a WP:BLP standpoint.  If multiple BLM protestors claim that they heard one of the (white) visitors say the N-word, and it was cited from some reliable source, that would probably change my opinion.  Can you see why this would be a different situation?     "	0|0|0|0|0|0

Question Hello Latics, I noticed that you revert vandalism occasionally. Would you like me to grant your account rollback rights to make vandal-fighting easier for you? Just remember that rollback, like Twinkle, should only be used to revert vandalism, and that misuse of the tool can lead to its removal. Tell me what you think. Thanks.	0|0|0|0|0|0
"I'm in twothree minds over this proposal. As regards redlinks, on the one hand, over the last two years of monitoring the topic, I've seen it used as a catalyst and incubator for new articles; on the other hand, it is arguable that a death reported in a WP:RS is of a person of some note, if not necessarily within our standards. On the third hand, we do get some no-hopers on the face of it, which is why we tend to allow a month for an interested editor to create an article, and then delete undeveloped entries as non-notable. In the second case, we perhaps should not interpret lack of interest as lack of notability, because it may be that interested editors are lacking; that's why the month moratorium seems to exist, as far as I can tell. andemu "	0|0|0|0|0|0

"Parts of my own Talk Page deleted by editors who think they know betterDear impartial but not disinteresed reader, Coren and I have been having an entertaining and enjoyable ""discussion"" on the finer points of ""soapboxing"".  She is of the firm, resolute belief that this version of my own talk page amounts to ""soapboxing"" and has deleted it.  I recognize that there may be elements of soapboxing in the ""investment predictions for 2008"" section at the bottom of the page, but have given her the opportunity to amend rather than delete the whole section.  She has declined the opportunity to amend, leaving me in the difficult position of having to type this with a knife pressed ever-so-gently against my back, with Coren carefully looking over my shoulder at the screen to check whether anything is, in her God-like view, ""soap-like"".  Not the most pleasant position to be in, I can assure you.To use another example, picked completely at random: Let's say there's been a nasty and vicious and ugly and persistent edit war over, say, fractional reserve banking, and a number of editors want a messy but more informative version like this one kept in.  Then let's say I post this earlier version on my talk page for readers to compare with the now in-my-humble-view slaughtered version.  Is that ""soapboxing""??To use another example, closer to home.  Let's say a guy like Zenwhat says to his co-conspirators, ""What can we do to have OUR version of debt-based monetary system/fractional reserve banking prevail?"", like he clearly said here under the (desperate?) heading ""Heeeeelp"".  And then he also (bizarrely?) asks Gregalton help him delete references to Mises.org like he did here, saying to Gregalton: ""Also, in case you're interested, one of the easiest ways to find economics articles that have been vandalized is to do a search for links to Mises.org""As if a reference to the great Ludwig von Mises amounted to VANDALISM? Can you BELIEVE IT?  I have to hold a pencil between my teeth just to keep control of myself and keep typing this.  The guy is clearly a vicious tiny weeny little troll.  He also says to his co-conspirator the following, on the same page: ""I looked at the fractional reserve banking article recently and saw how it was so horribly vandalized. It made me realize that we're going around in circles. We improve the articles to the point that they look great. Then they get screwed up again. So, I had an idea: Would you be interested in helping me write an essay on ""Monetary Crankery""? It could help people who AREN'T educated...The idea is for it to be straightforward, with references, but polemic and satirical of monetary crankery.""Clearly this guy is obsessed with deleting or ""satirizing"" any positions on monetary theory that don't agree with his.  (The guy is mad.  If the guy had napalm or nukes he'd use them without hesitation.)   Then, for good measure, he goes back to debt-based monetary system to do more ""editing"".  Zenwhat is clearly a piece of work.  Check out the dude's talk page.  In addition to his obsessive interest in deleting anything associated with Mises.org, his main interests appear to be something called ""cannabis culture"" and ""the Buddhist connection with marijuana"".  So, I gather from this that his main ""interests"" are monetary theory and dope smoking.  What a combo!Seeing this, I ponder my options.  I decide to post a note here, ON MY OWN TALK PAGE, asking readers to compare older (better?) versions of some important articles on monetary theory with the current versions.  For good measure I offer my predictions on the financial markets for 2008 as a gift to the (eight?) people persistent enough to read my humble little talk page.  It immediately gets deleted by all-seeing, all-knowing Coren as ""soapboxing"".  Is this strict compliance with WP guidelines or a WP-style Fascist Dictatorship where people like Coren delete at will, but don't bother to make CONSTRUCTIVE suggestions as to how what I have written CAN come within the guidelines?    This is like watching evolution in reverse.  I carefully construct a page with the help of others.  It gets vandalized by those WITH A CLEAR AND OBVIOUS objective to delete or satirize all references to Ludwig von Mises or the Austrian School (who knows what motivates these sickos?).

Do we really need to go the extent of using a non-free image to show a panorama? Of course not- the destruction could easily be shown in other ways. We do not use a non-free image because it is better than other available images- we use a non-free image because it shows something that could not be shown in any other way that urgently needs to be shown.

"Just to make the point that I'm not making this problem up, here's the abstract of [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb039/is_/ai_n28889291 Who are the ""Canadians""?: Changing census responses, 1986-1996Canadian Ethnic Studies Journal,  Spring, 2001  by Monica Boyd,  Doug Norris]: ""At the close of the twentieth century, ""Canadian"" has become the fastest growing ethnic origin group, up from 0.5 percent in 1986 to nearly 4 percent in 1991 and to 31 percent in the 1996 census of Canada. From what groups did this ""indigenous"" label draw in the five years between the 1986-1991 and the 1991-1996 censuses? Using unpublished tabulations from the 1986, 1991 and 1996 Canadian censuses, this paper traces temporal shifts for a cohort of the Canadian-born age 25-44 in 1986 (and age 34-54 by 1996). We find that most of the increases between 1986 and 1991 in ""Canadian"" ethnic origin responses are accompanied by intercensal losses in British origin responses. Between 1991 and 1996, increasing Canadian responses went hand in hand with dramatic losses in both the British and French ethnic origin counts. In some provinces, notably the Prairie provinces of Alberta, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan, shifts also occurred out of other ethnic groups.""   "	0|0|0|0|0|0

Jab We Met == While visiting the Jab We Met article, I was very much impressed at your good work. However I've one small grudge that I raised on the article's talk page as well. This refers to the excessive number of non-free fair-use images in the article. As per the non-free guidelines the usage of excessive images is to be reduced and to be limited as much as possible. Most of these images carry Shahid and Kareena's images and hence 6 images is far too high. I was hoping to discuss this with you before removing them from the article page. Also I hope that you don't mind me doing quick checks for MOS consistency and additional info.   ==	0|0|0|0|0|0

" Talk:Ramon Berenguer III, Count of Barcelona Talk:Ramon Berenguer III, Count of Barcelona might interest you.   Peter III of Aragon What is your rationale for preferring the late portrait of Peter over a contemporary coin? Your edits are predominantly changes to lead images, yet you almost never leave an edit summary explaining them. You also reverted my change without even knowing what ""contemporary"" means or whether a certain image was contemporary with the subject or not. The reasons to prefer the coin are:it is a contemporary artefact, giving information about Peter's reign (w/ a caption) and about how he was seen by his subjects in his lifetimethe coin does not mislead readers about the times of Peter III, as the portrait mightthe silver coin on a white background is more striking than the somewhat garish portrait in low-resolution JPG formatit is far more likely that the limited detail of the coin is accurate (clean shaven and long-haired) than the greater detail of the imaginary portraitthe later portrait is one of a series of nearly indistinguishable royal portraits from two centuries later, it gives us no information about Peter or his reign, its sole purpose was decorativewhat makes the coin an image of Peter is that that is when it was struck and what for, but what makes the later portrait an image of Peter is that somebody labelled it that way—they could just as easily have labelled an image of any other Aragonese kingIn your last edit summary, you ask ""if I have to choose between two unreal representations, I prefer the portrait"", but nobody is asking you to choose or what you prefer.   Srnec, the problem is that we have different criteria.You think the images should provide information about the lives of the persons and be of the age in which these people lived. I think the only thing to do is to give a visual representation of the person, the article is to the information.I think that a portrait (even if wasn't painted during the live of the person) is most valid that a little image carved in a coin. The two representations have the same chance of not being 100% accurate, but at least one illustrates better than the other.If not exist any portrait of this person, then I accept a coin's image or a poor drawing. But the present picture accomplish the role and I think that it must be more time.  I already argued why the coin is a better illustration and you've just asserted the contrary. Do you have an argument? Why are your criteria better than mine?   Really? When I rebutted all your arguments in your talk page, I stated my reasons. But I do not want another long discussion with you. I offer consensus. Would you take a picture of the first part of the thirteenth century?  Both of those are improvements over the 17th-century image, but not over the coin. At least one other editor agrees with me.   Sorry I'm not agree with your second comment, but I hope we have made ​​a step in the right direction. This discussion is already too long. Both images are the best ones that meet your rigid standard of closeness to the character's life. Either both seem right.   Imposing your personal preference is not how it occurs on Wikipedia I noticed in the message above that this is not the first time that you try to impose pictures on articles regardless of what others think. You are not allowed to impose your will. Both Pedro I of Brazil and Pedro II of Brazil are Featured Articles. They were reviewed by several editors. Stop with your edit warring.   Lecen is aware of the three-revert rule. Are you? You've reverted four times on both Pedro I and Pedro II in the last 24 hours. You should undo your last revert and seek dispute resolution, such as discussion on the talk page or a request for comment.	0|0|0|0|0|0

Regarding AZ helping Ahmed Ressam get to Canada  my reading of his CSR Transcript is exactly the opposite.  He asked Ahmed Ressam if he could get him five (stolen?) Canadian passports, because he was tired of being a stateless person in Pakistan.Regarding whether AZ ran the Khaldan camp  didn't he testify that he hadn't paid a visit to Khaldan for years?  I thought his testimony confirmed that he was part of the camp's management team.  But, if the camp had been a college I think his role(s) would be closest to that of the college registrar and placement officer.  A registrar confirms that applicants grades are in order, and officially informs them that they have been admitted.  AZ ran houses where he formed an assessment as to whether applicants were good candidates for training.  And, once they finished their training, he helped those who wanted to go fight in Chechnya or Israel to slip into those conflict zones.  He had helped grads slip into Bosnia, during the civil war there.  I think it would have been more accurate to say Ibn al Shaykh al Libi ran the camp.  His location was a secret for four years.  He was found in a Libyan prinson in April, by human rights workers, who conducted an initial interview with him.  And a few weeks later the Libyans reported he committed suicide.  I really think it would serve public safety if we had heard his version  his pre-torture versions  of what the camp did.	0|0|0|0|0|0
"As I suspected, complete nonsense. Your statement is so silly that I can't begin to tell you how wrong it is. You said, ""You there presume that your not-yet-filed Arbcom case has been decided"". I assure you that this was not the case - I would consider that to be a stupid assumption. I am not a stupid person. I would therefore ask that you assume good faith on my part, and withdraw everything on this page based on your mind-reading trick.You quote out of context and misrepresent when you describe part of my questioning as the ""lack the intellectual ability comment""By the perverted interpretation of standards you are trying to apply to me, your accusation of me not treating others as human beings is a personal attack.

What then is this articles content?Hmm, let's see … the ArbCom is an article, so what is the ArbCom made of? Why, members. So that means the content of the committee is it's members. So an election is a decision on the content of this article.So.Members are editors, so content is editors, so in order to write this article we must discuss the content.We must discuss the editor who is to become part of the content.You don't like that?WP:Civil, WP:AGF & WP:NPA  are all policies written in mind for the writing of encyclopaedic articles.But ArbCom is not an article. It is an election to decide which persons are to be members of that important committee.We must discuss the editors who are to become members of the committee.We cannot question articles about their content, nor can we ask the content questions, but we can ask the proposed contents of the ArbCom questions.Is a certain level of intellectual ability pertinent to ArbCom membership? If you do not think so, how many of the present ArbCom do you consider stupid? Would a low intellect on ArbCom help or hinder? If there is evidence (a diff) of intellectual failings, does the candidate realise this failing? Can he explain it as something other than an intellectual failing? The questions were politely put. They were challenging, and they were meant to be, and anyone in the community (which includes me) has the right to ask candidates challenging questions on their past performance. There was no name calling, all questions were relevant to a quality of the candidate pertinent to his ability to perform on ArbCom. They were not deferential. Which may be the actual cause of the consternation you and others displayed.Your threats of blocks I regard as an attempt to bully. Do not try to bully me.Finally I would contrast the participation of admin's in this ANI with the marshalling of forces which you participated in, and then came here.   "	0|0|0|0|0|0

What do you consider primary sources in this context?  She notes the obvious homoerotic passages in Rydberg's poetry and fiction, which are primary sources for literary criticism.  The details of Rydberg's sexually troubled childhood and his uneasy relationship with women were presumably taken from his standard biographical sources.  I have no idea what sources Svanberg and Stolpe used; I can't ask them.  Again, no other scholar has questioned the accuracy of their conclusions, which seems to me to be the definition of a scholarly consensus.	0|0|0|0|0|0

Too much of the information you've re-added are unsourced, others are supported by sources that don't speak to the content you're adding. Do not use content from sources and then draw your own interpretations of what they mean. Also, bear in mind that sources that come from editorials or opinion pieces need to be represented in the article as opinions, not relayed as fact.

No JP is not a good source and I will remove it pending a better source. My Issue is JP has an agenda. I came across them when checking the edit which one editor put in. But They seemed very keen on JP when one editor used it to say Muslims were a tiny tiny percentage. (i never knew JP up until then). See the edit history for this edit. Now here is what I do know. Go and look at all the notable Seer, start with NDour, what is his religion? 100% Muslim. What I am realizing is most Serer are Muslim people. Synergistic is  not unique to Africa, it is in every corner of the planet where Islam and Christianity live. So Islam accommodates this, all the key historian on Islam say this. especially David Robinson and others. Vodon per Kwami is a good example. Even in the Caribbean google Jesus in the morning Vodon in the evening. These people are classified as Christian.  I do not think we will get exact stats but should not go with the POV that most Serer practices their religion, which is a myth. note  any strange ip edits can be investigated.	0|0|0|0|0|0
Thanks. I am not entirely familiar with the First Austrian Republic awards system, but given the common cross was a service award for a month's service in the Freikorps, and as it was awarded to just about everyone who served, I don't think it should be included.

I propose adding the exact date of the award of the Verleihung der Ehrenbürgerschaft into the text where the award is already mentioned. I understand the Medal of Merit in Gold was a lower award, but am unsure how common or notable it might be.

blocked me accusing me for trolling. If he, you and others believe I’m a troll please keep blocking. If Hillary Clinton is a troll then I’m more than happy to be a troll too. If Hillary Clinton is not a troll then I’m not a troll too. If you believe I’m not a troll please first unblock and then block again for the right reasons. After that we would have a base for an evaluation based on the right accusations. Till then my defend line is what Hillary Clinton said “I would like to offer a historic perspective and not to compare Putin with Hitler”. Thanks.	0|0|0|0|0|0

Actually, you can use thumbnails for images with licenses that allow for it. Fair use is just another name of using a copyrighted work under a strict and narrowly defined way ... you can ONLY use it to illustrate the object. Even if you had uploaded it, the image is still copyrighted. Any usage of it outside the strict fair use criteria isn't allowed, and so, user pages/subpages cannot have fair use images (see #8 on the criteria page). Hope this helps.	0|0|0|0|0|0

"Fair use rationale for Image:TranquilityPark.jpgThanks for uploading or contributing to Image:TranquilityPark.jpg. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. In addition to the boilerplate fair use template, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use. Suggestions on how to do so can be found  here.Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale. Using one of the templates at Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline is an easy way to ensure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template.  Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page. If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the ""my contributions"" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting ""Image"" from the dropdown box.

Johann Hari pic Hi JacoPlame - The picture of Johann Hari that you agreed to post has now been given the correct copyright-free status at flickr:http://www.flickr.com/photos/75377964@N00/?saved=1It turns out the picture of Hari currently on the article is not actually him (I e-mailed him, and he looked at it and informed me of this - see the discussion page) so as soon as you could correct it, that would be great.It's probably best not to unfreeze the page though. There is still no consensus since the user Felix-Felix, who has in the past inserted libellous falsehoods and the current fake picture into the entry, is refusing any offers of a compromise. As you can see if you check out the discussion page, he has declared that he wants to unilaterally delete any of the critics he disagrees with, and wants to quote only the one group he happens to agree with, Medialens.

"Put Me Out singleHello, how are you? I joined wikipedia after some usage and learning of the site to try to add my input and inprove some pages that I knew were missing some information. I noticed you removed that I added ""put me out"" by The Used from the single list.  Although they made a video for it, they also released it with its own 'single' artwork cover and its recieved airplay on the radios across the USA which makes it a proper single. You can see all this information here: http://www.91x.com/pages/newmusic?The-Used-Put-Me-Out=1&blockID;=624659&feedID;=7098 and much more information confirming it is a single by a simple google search of the used put me out single.

Vandalizing the Macedonian towns Freestypefrappe, I will not stay calm until you stop vandalizing the Kumanovo page talking only about murdering, blood, terrorism and nothing about the city normal life. Of course, there were moments in the Kumanovo’s history when a terrorist attacks took place, but Kumanovo is most of the time a quiet ordinary Macedonian town that doesn’t deserve such descriptions.  It is the same as if you write an article about London not mentioning St Paul’s catedral, Westminster, Tower bridge.. and writing only about recent terrorist attacks in the London underground. Talking about copyvios, I noticed that you are using text written by Christopher Deliso.

RingmailI don't know if he regards himself as an expert, I've sweated enough to know for sure that a broigne is not a victorian mistake, and to find citable sources for it. I understand that the English language wor;ld lacks proper history on the subject, but from a continental point of view, there's no mistake possible that ringmail is different from chainmail and was used in the period between the fall of Rome and the comeback of chainmail in the late 1100s. Also, the high handed way in which he remade all the article with no regard for the effots of those who came before him, and without even setting up an account for people to discuss the matter with him wxas, to my view, qualification for vandalism.I'm quite willing to include the bit about representations making it difficult to differenciate between chainmail and ringmail, and the possibility of misconceptions in the 1800s, but the basic matter as established with my collaboration stands, even if it has to be edited further.	0|0|0|0|0|0

For Daniel CaseHi Daniel. The block is extremely odd. IMO, there is no real discussion of my activity in that AN thread in connection with a siteban. Jehochman, whom I have some history with, floated the idea of a siteban. Durova, who has been on my case steady for months on behalf of Cirt, generally bad-mouths me about abusive sockpuppetry, etc but does not ask for a siteban and a few admins float some ideas and come up with this account restriction idea by Ryulong. I agree to it. Then Ryulong backs away from his idea and from the whole thing. Blueboy, a new admin that improperly blocked me, an established editor, as his very first admin action three weeks ago and whom I blew up at and insulted decides to siteban me. He is supported by, guess who, Jehochman, Durova, and Athaenara, whom I also have history with and whose WP:RFA I made a bit difficult and embarrassing by bringing up her past actions with me. I can provide diffs for all of this but I want to show you one thread now, over at Wikinews. Durova comes over there to badmouth and lie about me and a neutral admin, luckily, takes the time to look at the diffs and see who is really harassing whom, here. I invite a neutral admin to do the same here. I have to run now. Please let me know how you would like to proceed. Thanks.	0|0|0|0|0|0

" I am not sure if I understand your reply above correctly: UNSD uses the term  ""statistics divisions""  ( I agree, but the term refers to division(s) in the UN headquarter or agencies in different countries, NOT a specific way of geographic divisions of the world.) You still prefer previous title (i.e. ""United Nations statistical divisions"") to the current one (i.e. ""United Nations geoscheme"")?If so, please allow me to repeat a bit on the following: The term ""Statistics Division""(capitalized singular form) in the UN context refers to the organization of United Nations Statistics Division with the website at unstats.un.org. The term ""statistical divisions""(plural form) can mean any categorization schemes, not just geographical ones. Google this: ""statistical divisions"" site:un.org The term ""statistical divisions""(plural form) can ALSO mean any organization bodies who are doing statisitcal work in governments.  Google this: ""statistical divisions"" site:un.orgTherefore, it is not advisable to use the ambigous general term ""statistical divisions"", or the wrong organization term  ""Statistics Division"" to refer to UN M.49 . UN statistical divisions can refer to any agencies doing statisitcal work under the UN system, or imply that there are certain UN statistical categorization schemes in a general sense (not geographical). I agree that UN geoscheme is widely used for stastitcs and ALSO mapping. Natural Earth has region_un and subregion metadata for each country. I use it quiet often. It is why I notice that most of academic work refer this geographic categorization/classification scheme as ""UN geoscheme"". Try Google BOOK search and you will find at least the following:""The best option to identify the states from Asia could be use the United Nations (UN) geoscheme for Asia. As per this, Asia is subdivided to four broad categories:....""""The UN geoscheme defines the region as all states of mainland North America south of the United States; conversely, the European Union excludes Belize and Mexico from its definition of the region ....""""Country groups are based on UN Geoscheme and World Bank regional classification.""""...were grouped into regions and subregions based on the United Nations Geoscheme (http://unstats.un.org /unsd/methods/m49/m49regin.htm)""""... that the United Nations Statistics Division would later classify as Eastern Asia, Southern Asia and Southeastern Asia according to its geoscheme. In fact ...""I also agree that many UN agencies (in fact, many other reports, consultancies, etc. have different ""statistical divisions"" (in the general sense of categorization schemes) for research. This is exactly why I believe the term ""UN geoscheme"" is better. Although it is NOT official term or a technical term (UN M.49), I have not yet found an ambigous use of the term. Correct me if I am wrong on this, so far every online and academic citations that I have found when the term  ""UN geoscheme"" is used, it refers to exactly the regions and subregions as defined in UN M.49 . Moving forwards, since don't have the time nor will to take it to RM, and if you do not have any further couter-evidence or -arguments with the evidence and claims that I layed out above, I can help by making the necessary editing without going to RM. Of course, if you still have lingering concerns, please summarize your current arguments (preferrably after considering the evidence that I have already presented) and new evidence/citations here, before I bring it to RM.

Section 'Subdivisions' should be more than a list. I hate to complain about a problem, rather than just fix the problem, but I really don't know enough about biology to be productive here.The Problem: I read eudicots, rosids, and asterids.  Although each article lists some representative species, I (the reader) have no understanding what criteria was used to subdivide eudicots into rosids and asterids (and others).  Why is one plant a rosid but not an asterid?  These articles read as though plant life is subdivided arbitrarily, though I suspect the subdivision is somewhat rational.  My intuition tells me that there must be some expressible, meaningful distinction between these subgroups.The Proposal: Is there some way to describe the grouping here?   I propose a brief summary of the characteristics which divide rosids and asterids.  I think this summary should be a list of differences, each difference taking this form: Rosids feature X.  In contrast, Asterids feature Y.Thanks, 71.63.4.110	0|0|0|0|0|0

" Re:Dennis Brown's final warning I didn't mention that it was mutual because it was not relevant. I didn't violate the final warning; CurtisNaito did (multiple times). The exact wording of the warning was ""If either editor pushes the boundaries of incivility, bludgeons a discussion, violates WP:IDHT, acts in a disruptive manner on any talk page, or breaching any other policy that makes editing miserable for other editors, then either myself or another admin should simply block for a minimum of 72 hours."" At no point did I push the boundaries of civility, bludgeon a discussion, violate IDHT, act in a disruptive manner on any talk page, or breach any other policy that made editing miserable for other editors. CurtisNaito displayed the exact same kind of IDHT behaviour that has made editing miserable for me and multiple other editors on numerous occasions, and when told explicitly that he was violating Dennis Brown's final warning, he kept doing it.Your choosing to butt in with a comment about how the warning was mutual, when nothing I had done could conceivably be taken as a violation of the warning, was an off-topic attack against me with no basis in what actually happened.I understand you don't like me, but would you please keep it to the appropriate forums rather than continuously posting personal attacks against me on other users' talk pages where normal etiquette prevents me from responding directly?

Gothic Metal and Death Rock Nice call on the removing of metal traces in the Death Rock article.

Perhaps the Death Rock and Gothic Rock articles could do with a bit of an overhaul. Ive seen that youve edited the Death Rock article quite a bit, so i assume you know a lot about the subject.I suggest, if your willing to listen, that you read the Gothic Metal article. Firstly so you better understand what it is, and secondly so you can work better with it, and its contents, on drawing the big black line (or pink if you prefer) that divides the two by a long way.I call out to you as a fellow editor of articles, simply because i do not know enough about Goth Rock or Death Rock to compently edit them, mainly due to my work and association in the metal scene.

Records of Awesome Editors Who Truly Want To Help=='As this is not a study of people's hesitancy, it is not a suitable source for claims about the reasons for people's hesitancy. It would appear to be at best a study making claims about vaccines themselves, not a study about hesitancy or about controversy. If this study is the reason for people's hesitancy, then we should be pointing to a reliable third-party source that states that it's the reason, not to the study itself. If we say people stopped going to the beach because of the film Jaws, we use as a reference the source that makes that statement, not the film itself. So no, it's not a reliable source for what you claim you want to use it for. Nat Gertler (talk) That has got to be the clearest explanation yet. So what you are saying is cite a source that says there is controversy over the vaccine schedule because there is a correlation with infant mortality, then cite both sources? Or should I use opinion pieces like most of the other references in the article? Even the journal of medicine piece is an opinion piece. Is this where wiki gets the facts, from opinions, then excludes peer reviewed journal articles because it is WP:OR? It is built by popular opinion of the editors, from opinion pieces, not allowing facts...if this is indeed true....though I hope notDcrsmama (talk) No, I'm not saying cite both sources. References are there to verify the facts that are being stated in Wikipedia's voice. If the statement being sourced is that there is a controversy due to correlation with infant mortality, then we cite a source that is discussing the controversy - there is no need to cite the study. Even if the source says that there is a controversy because of this particular study, we might mention this study in the text, but the study itself is not reference for the statement. And I am addressing the specific request for input that you made in your initial posting. If you have concerns about the other sources in the article, you may wish to raise them in a specific post about the specific concerns. Nat Gertler (talk) 'From WP:RPS==	0|0|0|0|0|0

So, the link was a personnal attack? How funny. And I thought it was a good critic on your contribution on this page. Here without the external link, just for you:Only me who is arguing? You have been blocking anybody who does not agree with you on this issue. Shameful! And now you want to find a way to make her less Portuguese than Canadian. What a joke: “Stating that she is no more Canadian than she is Portuguese is misleading. She was born in Canada and she lives in Canada.” Where are your sources for such a brilliant comment? You should apply for an award for the silliest entry on wikipedia. ” but come on, let's get real here” this not an acceptable comment from an administrator who also erased information with reliable sources just to get his own way. Now you decide there are different degrees of nationality being the Canadian the top one. Pathetic. And you say it is personal attack if I consider that you have a xenophobic view on this issue because you underestimating one nationality to emphasize the other? Your own! Your  neutrality on this issue is something inexistent: “content must be written from a neutral point of view (NPOV), representing fairly and without bias all significant views (that have been published by reliable sources This is non-negotiable and expected on all articles, and of all article editors)” “The other two are Wikipedia:Verifiability and Wikipedia:No original research”.You not only erased reliable sources that say she is Portuguese-Canadian, you also have no sources whatsoever to claim she is more Canadian than Portuguese, if such a thing ever exists other than in your mind, show the sources, if you can prove it is not your own “original theory”. “The current version clearly states that she holds both nationalities.” What a lie, citizenship is not the same as nationality and even nationality could have a different meaning depending of context, and if what you claim was true , you would not be erasing all the time that she is Portuguese-Canadian.	0|0|0|0|0|0

FK Vardar FK Vardar is a Macedonian Football club, the club changed its name several times during its history, from original Vardar in 1911 to Citizens Football Club Vardar or just Citizens( Gragjanski in Macedonian ) in 1920, then Football Club Makedonija in 1946 and finally back to FC Vardar in 1947. By the name FC Citizens( Vardar ) the club won 4 championships from 1936 till 1939. About Yugoslavia, you have to know that Yugoslavia was a federation of 6 Republics -countries together and each Republic had its own championship, and there was a Federal League where teams from the Republics competed together. Each Republic had its own Cup and the cup winners competed in the Marshals Cup, that cup was held in honor of Joseph Broz the marshal of the Federation, and its was called the Cup of the Marshal. How ever FC Vardar never won the Federal league ( League made of Federation of 6 Republics best teams ,thats why its called the Federal League, and not Yugoslavian League nor Yugoslavian Cup). The title in 1987 was won by FC Partizan Belgrade , you can check in any official statistics or documents. The second federal league was made of two Second Federal Leagues , East ( 3 Republics competed, Serbia ,Monte Negro,Macedonia and two Provinces- almost the same as Republics but yet without a nation ,those were Kosovo and Vojvodinship ) and West ( 3 Republics, Croatia, Bosnia and Slovenia, sometimes clubs from province Vojvodinship  would compete in the West depending on the federation decisions ). In the period of 1922 till 1929, present day Republic of Macedonia was established as 4 provinces within the Kingdom of Serbs Croats and Slovenes, those 4 provinces were Skopje, Bitola,Shtip and Vranje prvinces. These 4 provinces established the Macedonian Football Federation in 1926,and they held 3 championships. In 1929 these 4 provinces joined in one Duchy and this championship was held in the Duchy ( Banovina ) for 11 times.During the WW2 the championship was held under German Occupation, and the German government recognized this League. After the WW2 the very same championship was tranformed in to Republic Football League ,just the Province of Vranje was separated from the Republic as Macedonia transformed from Duchy to a Republic and the province of Vranje was under the newly made Republic of Serbia in 1946. The bottom line is since the Federation of 6 Republics split in the 90s, Macedonian Republic League was transformed in to Macedonian First League. So it is the same League that changed names and competition format during the decades, and now it came to this Level. Its a petty that there is lots of politics and territorial pretensions lots of denial of the existence of the Macedonia and other Republics in the Federation , by the Serbian side. Serbian official politic is to show that Yugoslavia was one country and nation mainly based on Serb character and they are stilling all the history including history of sports in this case football. They are trying to show the world that there was Yugoslav nation ( Serb ) and only Yugoslav Football league ( Serb League ) denying the Federal League second Federal League and Republic Leagues. They want to show only Yugoslav League and not the real Federal League. They hold all the champions from the Federal League as Serbian Champions in every competition. For FC Vardar at this point of view considering that  Macedonia is not in the Federetion for more than 20 years,and it wont be in the future ,the most important are the titles and trophies won in the Macedonian League , and if you wont to put additional trophies won in the Federation ,the period before 1991 you should write the precise information. Second Federal League East is the name of the competition, and you should put the Macedonian Flag from that period of the time next to it,instead of the federal flag, simply because that federation dont exist anymore and doesnt represent any country nor nation. About the cup , you should write down the real proper name as it was called ,Marshals Cup also fallowed by Macedonian flag from that period of the time, you should put a notice that in the Federal Second League East , clubs from Serbia Macedonia and Monte Negro competed including the provinces of Kosovo i Vojvodinship.	0|0|0|0|0|0

"Hello Barto. I am curious as to what your motivation is in editing on the Ron Gostick page and are you the creator of it?  As stated on the talk page there, you are correct in stating that internet sources which are few come from mostly the extreme right or left.  These are terms both I and Ron, himself would acknowledge as being artificially misleading characterisations and could not be ascribed to him or the associates of the Canadian League of Rights. I could explain why here, but I won't bore you with the details.However, I do reject the notion that everything must link to a Wiki article.  I am editing at another page, where there is no objection to verifiable external sourcesinternet or hard copy. I will not object to so-called Left or Right sources, as long as there are sources from external links to associations and people connected to Mr. Gostick.  The archives at the Australian League of Rights will have plenty of published materials on him, League objectives and views or anyone associated with him. This is one link that was removed in favor of David Lethbridge's document (hardly a non-politcally unbiased character considering he represents everything the opposite of what Gostick and the League of Rights stood for).I will try to help you find sources, fair and credible in the near future, doing edits myself.  I just want to know if you have a bias of your own or are willing to be neutral on some claims made about him.  I know well what he and the League of Rights stand for, as I have been involved with it for near 30 yrs. There is no denying he was anti-totalitarianism and that includes anti-zionist, which automatically brings down the bogus smear of ""anti-semitism' and other such nonsense.  An editor should have at least some familiarity with the subject he is decidedly determined to write about.I have notified Paul Fromm of the wiki page and link to him at Gostick's page, in case he didn't know it existed.  Be aware that Wikipedia has come under criticism for pages created on living persons, edited by vandals with damaging false claims unknown to the subject of the article until much later.  One was a recent high-level member of the Kennedy administration and believe me he made a public stink about it.  Living or dead, I don't care to see this happen to anyone.

Hey. It is my judgement in the matter of David Tombe that you wikipedia editors do not like to actually receive criticism, but you do like to dish it out in a nasty and abusive manner. You have to change this attitude on your part. Your attitude is that everyone has to agree with the consensus, even if it is demonstrably wrong!!!! In my experience david is absolutely right in what he says. You guys are of course wrong. You prevent correction of your obviously wrong errors by blocking this legitimate criticism. That is why your efforts are worthless and wikipedia is just not usable as a source except to cite misinformation on a topic that is being disseminated. Every day I find dumb stupid or just plain false statements on wikipedia. I think it should be banned as it is not accurate in any way that I can determine.

For the record, I was serious about running in the RFA.  I was not trolling or disrupting, I was advised that I should run in the RFA to see how it was like, and I did so.  There should have been more questions during the RFAif there was any questions about sincerity.  The RFA was not a joke, it was serious.  I feel I should have been made an Admin and then would have been the better example.  I felt that there was a possibility for confirmation and this should serve as example for other users to be afraid of self nominations to the RFA, even when there is clearly a poll support for running in the RFA.  As I am truely afraid, shocked and dismayed at the admins response.As it seems now there is a new rule, if the admin feel you are faking your RFA, they can block you with zero assumptions of good faith.	0|0|0|0|0|0

See also Wikipedia:Referencing for beginners, for how to cite sources here.Aside from limited quotation, you must put all information in your own words and structure, in proper paraphrase. Following the source's words too closely can create copyright problems, so it is not permitted here; see Wikipedia:Close paraphrasing. (There is a college-level introduction to paraphrase, with examples, hosted by the Online Writing Lab of Purdue.) Even when using your own words, you are still, however, asked to cite your sources to verify information and to demonstrate that the content is not original research. Our primary policy on using copyrighted content is Wikipedia:Copyrights. You may also want to review Wikipedia:Copy-paste. If you own the copyright to the source you want to copy or are a designated agent, you may be able to license that text so that we can publish it here. However, there are steps that must be taken to verify that license before you do. See Wikipedia:Donating copyrighted materials.In very rare cases (that is, for sources that are public domain or compatibly licensed), it may be possible to include greater portions of a source text. However, please seek help at the help desk before adding such content to the article. 99.9% of sources may not be added in this way, so it is necessary to seek confirmation first. If you do confirm that a source is public domain or compatibly licensed, you will still need to provide full attribution; see Wikipedia:Plagiarism for the steps you need to follow.Also note that Wikipedia articles may not be copied without attribution. If you want to copy from another Wikipedia project or article, you can, but please follow the steps in Wikipedia:Copying within Wikipedia.It's very important that contributors understand and follow these practices, as policy requires that people who persistently do not must be blocked from editing. If you have any questions about this, you are welcome to leave me a message on my talk page.  Thank you.  I believe the source is WWF India.   If this is a shared IP address, and you did not make the edits, consider creating an account for yourself so you can avoid further irrelevant notices."	0|0|0|0|0|0

I'm a little confused as to what you mean. The blue shields can appear on even fairly minor roads - Route 64, although a fairly major route in the western suburbs, takes in all sorts of fairly minor roads which wouldn't even be notable enough for an article on Wikipedia. Perth in that sense is not terribly different to its east coast counterparts. Orderinchaos	0|0|0|0|0|0

, 5 July 2008 (UTC)The reason I chose to rename the page to APR308 is because it was simply the first rifle developed in the series, the primary model, which was then developed into the specialized variants, the Police, Suppressed and .338 rifles. Like with the Arctic International rifles. The AW was the first model and was the basis for the entire line-up. Unless I am mistaken about the APR project timeline.   19:54	0|0|0|0|0|0

"First, if you create obviously bogus claims, nobody needs to waste his time refuting the claim as applied to each excerpt you cut and paste.  One refutation is more than sufficient.  Second, your rationales appear to be shifting.  Originally you claimed that the article contained ""creative facts"" and POV statements.  Now you claim that a particular statement is unverifiable.  Be very specific about what you find problematic citing the specific Wikipedia policy.  Given your contentious history with this article (dating back over a year) it is evident that your goal is to portray the eXile as an uncredible source.  I believe you will reject any claims that undermine this premise, regardless of their consistency with Wikipedia policy.  Consequently, if you want to be taken seriously, you need act cooperatively to resolve issues.  This means being specific in your complaints, citing the exact policy.  This means no specious claims.  And this means accepting the article as ""undisputed"" if you don't have any specific issues.  Can you abide by these conditions?   "	0|0|0|0|0|0

"(deindent) Sorry for kibitzing, but I wanted to be fair to all points of view, even those of the dualists. so I tried to stick to presenting the thought experiments without drawing conclusions.The thought experiment is this: you have one observer The observer gets cloned into copy 1 and copy 2 (either Hubert/Yorick or star-trek style) The copies diverge, either because of internal noise, or because of the environmentFrom a third person point of view, this is an objective description of the evolution of a physical system, there is absolutely no ambiguity about what is going on- one observer becomes two. If probed, each copy would say that they were the initial observer before the cloning event. But viewed from the inside, if you are the observer getting cloned, there is a very natural question you can ask: Am I going to end up being copy 1 or am I going to be copy 2? This question cannot even be formulated from the outside, so it has no objective answer, but it is subjectively very important if you are the observer.This scenario is Dennett's (and to some extent Everett's). Since the question doesn't even make sense when formulated in the third person perspective, the answer to this question does not lie in the position and velocities of any atoms. You might conclude that this question doesn't make any sense. But, in any case, the answer to this question is 1 bit of subjective information which both copy 1 and copy 2 know, and which the original observer does not. In the objective third person view, there is no information gained- you know that copy 1 will say ""I am copy 1"" and copy 2 will say ""I am copy 2"".To give an example of actual OR and SYNTH, I'll go beyond Dennett's example: suppose that the copying goes on indefinitely, so that the cloning keeps happening again and again. Then it is very difficult to say what it feels like for the observer, from the first person perspective. For example, take a star-trek duplicator, and duplicate the observer, and then duplicate each duplicate, but add a twist: the duplicator keeps the data from the first duplication event in its memory banks, and makes a third copy in the exact same state twenty years later, and starts duplicating that observer too in the same way. And then it does so again forty years later, then sixty years later. What is the subjective experience? From a naive counting perspective, I should predict that I would be nearly certainly teleported in time to some distant future point, because the number of future copies of my present state is vastly greater than the two present copies. On the other hand, the total number of observers descended from the current duplicates will always outnumber the observers descended from the future duplicates. So perhaps the right counting is by the number of descendents at each time slice, rather than by the total number of descendents of my present state. Even worse, how can my subjective experience change depending on whether somebody millions of years in the future turns off the darned duplicator? (Boltzmann's brain is a similar idea).

", 10 October 2013 (UTC)This is a non-trivial problem. Many perhaps most of the 5,000 editors with the highest edit count are likely to have diverse editing habits, I can think of two FA writers in that group, one who also has an awful lot of categorisation edits, another spends a lot of time on AWB. Any analysis of those 5,000 would need to work out the proportion of their edits that were of various types. Then there is the issue that you are not likely to have access to their deleted edits, and that a few of those editors have opted out of being analysed. But most importantly, the 5,000 accounts with the highest ever edit counts are not going to fully overlap with the currently most active 3,156. ''SpielChequers'' 12:48"	0|0|0|0|0|0

Yes you got it - the Govt lied.  See the talk page for CSELR (OK, I'm lazy and not typing current page name!).  They provided a business case summary but not a business case that the summary was created from.  I have provided the link to the index of papers produced (mainly email acceptances/rejections of meeting appointments btw) so you can confirm that the Business case was never provided.  There are no source documents for any figure contained in the Business Case Summary.  Some of the numbers are shown as incorrect from prior and post-TfNSW publications (such as with the Capacity claimed by GB on the MR for the Modification Approval yet the actual modification report states figures that are 50% lower.). I am one of 8 community reps for the project and am attempting to ensure the facts are put out for people to make their own minds up about.  That is why I have tried to use as neutral descriptions as possible rather than emotive language.  The minutes for the Community Rep meeting with TfNSW are sanitised and questions asked by the reps are not recorded not responses provided to the questions.  The terms of reference (open to the public to see) for the Community Rep meetings state that all questions will be answered within a time frame yet TfNSW are refusing to do this.  I have since discovered that 4 of the community reps are current employees of the State Govt and 1 is a past (self-proclaimed) senior executive of TfNSW.  So not only do they not tell the truth - they have also stacked the Community Reference Group.http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/lc/lctabdoc.nsf/cccc870c6126b1b6ca2571ee000318a4/6e2b81f5c474172fca257cee0023c16a?OpenDocument&Highlight;=0,light*,rail* = link to index of docs produced for 1st call That is why there was the 2nd call for papers specifically naming the missing documents as that was the only way for the Upper House MPs to publicly state - the Govt has not provided what we asked for as they were supposedly only going to be in the 'confidential (2) boxes that the MPs could not talk about after looking at.  By making the 2nd call for papers stating the docs not provided in the 1st call they made it public.  The outcome they expected was what ended up happening.	0|0|0|0|0|0

That hasn't changed, and so to say that because we currently have a coalition, of whatever party, means that the position of Deputy Prime Minister should be included alongside the heads of state and government is false. I am all for mentioning Nick Clegg as Deputy Prime Minister in the article, around the same place David Cameron is currently described as Prime Minister, but to put Clegg alongside the Queen and Prime Minister on the basis of it being a coalition government is not right. Now if the job were constitutionally defined as being the Prime Minister's second-in-command, and if Cameron were to die/resign suddenly Clegg would become Prime Minister, I would completely agree that he should be there, but it isn't. Clegg may be Deputy Prime Minister, but he is not deputy head of government, and so he should not be put alongside the head of state and head of government.	0|0|0|0|0|0

"Getting what specifically? So far Busby has been right about most things. His detractors are from the Nuclear Industry. He is a recognised expert and not as far to the extreme as you claim WP:HONESTY WP:NOTSCANDAL.

" Dubious claims about clearly non-transgenderd people This article lists a whole bunch of people whos transgender status is clearly wrong and others for whom it is highly speculative.  This isn't a list of people who ""kinda, sorta, there's a small chance, maybe"" are transgender.The ones who cross-dressed for some nefarious/deceptive purpose and not as a life style choice clearly can not be classified as transgender and should be removed from the article completely.  The fact that mythological figures such as Achilles were even added in the first place says a lot about the POV pushing of the people who supported it.  The only mythological one who might be considered transgenderes is Guan Yin.  The real life figures who did it to disguise themselves to avoid something (e.g. military service) or even to get into something where women are discriminated against.  They did it for deceptive purposes as well, so they can't really be considered transgendered.The pope one is laughable and definitely should be removed.  The one about Joan of Arc is based exclusively on an accustion from a unreliable source.  If they accused her of being a witch, should we have included her in a list of witches too?  Also, I'd like to see an authoritative source showing that she was even accused of it as it seems that it's most Wikipedia ripped sites and LGBT websites that site that as fact.And what are ""transvestite tendencies"" in reference to Ed Wood?  You need to start citing sources or I'm just going to start deleting them.  That goes mainly for the historical and mythological figurse section.Maxwell Klinger wasn't even a real transvestite, he only did that so he'd get a section 8 and get kicked out of the army.  Anyone who watched the show knows he would try all kinds of crazy stuff to get kicked out under the guise of being mentally ill.  This phrase describing the character is also very odd: ""Although a transvestite, he loudly denied any charges of homosexuality.""  What's the association between the two?Also, it appears they're using a warped definition of transgender here.  I've never heard a definition that would automatically include cross-dressers as if that automatically means they identify with the opposite gender rather than just enjoying the clothes.  I'm sorry, but this overly broad and incorrect definition of transgender is obviously an attempt just to make the list as long as possible. 28 June 2005 21:00 (UTC)"	0|0|0|0|0|0

"==Street Gang==Mr. Davis,Thanks for your note on my talk page; I really appreciate it, and it's an honor to receive communication from the author of such an important book.  As this article's creator and main editor, I'm sorry that you thought the review section was so negative.  Please understand that it was not my intention to present it that way or that I was in any way trying to disparage your book.  In my rush to get the article published, I did a google search and those are the reviews I found.  Also please understand that this is a Wikipedia article, and the article as it now stands will never be ""complete"".  It's a work in progress.  I thought an article about Street Gang was important enough to get out there.  I am by no means a professional writer, so I'm certain there are all kinds of weaknesses about it, so I depend upon the feedback of other more experienced editors.  I would've thought that the other sections of the article demonstrates my respect for you and for your work.  I appreciate your feedback, something I always welcome as a Wikipedia editor.  If you are aware of other sources that I wasn't able to locate, please send them my way, on my talk page.  I'll repeat this message via your webpage, to ensure that you see it.You should also know that I've taken it upon myself to improve all Sesame Street-related articles on Wikipedia.  It's a big project, and a great need.  For example, Sesame Street, at one point was actually a featured article, but it was recently downgraded for some really good reasons.  It's an unfortunate state at the current time.  Your book came out shortly after I took on the project, so it's been a boom for me.  I thought focusing on the history of the show was a natural place to start, so your book has been a valuable resource.  I've already started working on this article: History of Sesame Street, and if you look at the reference section, you'll see that I've used your book extensively.  It's also a work in progess, and no where near finished.  My goal is that at least this article get up to featured article status by Sesame Street's 40th anniversary in November.  I can't tell you how much your book has helped me.On a personal level, I wanted to tell you how much I enjoyed your book.  It was a fun read, and immensely interesting.  I was brought to tears many times, especially when I realized while reading about all that Joan Cooney and her team did to get the show on the air.  See, I'm turning 45 this year, which makes me old enough to be the first audience that watched it.  I had to put the book down to compose myself when I realized, ""They did all that for me!""  I appreciate learning about the struggles they all went through to affect my life so profoundly, and now the life of my own children, who are severely developmentally disabled and love the show as much as I did and still do.  I believe that Sesame Street deserves high quality articles on Wikipedia, and I've taken it upon myself to help accomplish that.  If you, as the ultimate expert, could assist me in that goal, I can't tell you how valuable that would be.  Again, thanks for the feedback and communication.   "	0|0|0|0|0|0

It's not really for us to decide what is a conspiracy theory, but indeed, the article rather confusingly mixes conspiracy claims and factual information about Jewish leaders in the Bolshevik movement. There was a recent newspiece, a quote by Putin: Times of Israel - Putin: First Soviet government was mostly Jewish. Apparently some people feel such quote is conspiracist whereas others say it's just a statement of a statistical fact. In any case, the option is #1, the article shouldn't imply any notion of Jewish participation in the early communist movement is a conspiracy theory. However, I'm not sure if that general topic (Jews in the bolshevik movement) should be covered in detail in this article.'	0|0|0|0|0|0

Jung And Einstein In 1895 Albert Einstein was a pupil at cantonal school in Aarau, Switzerland. In 1896, after school in Switzerland, Einstein renounced his German citizenship. Carl P. Jung was born in in the Swiss canton (or county) of Thurgau. While Jung worked on Wandlungen und Symbole der Libido (Psychology of the Unconscious), tensions grew between Freud and Jung. Frank P. Geyer continued to serve as a detective until August 15, 1903 when he resigned. He had been transferred to the 18th Police District in the United States. Detective Geyer had arrested James Anderson; whether this is the same Anderson mentioned in Detective Geyer's 1896 work is non-determinable. In 1912 tensions between the two psychologists came to a peak. In 1901-02 Albert Einstein acquired Swiss citizenship and completed a scientific paper, obtaining a teaching position at school in Schaffhausen, Switzerland. The FBI file on Einstein came to light in 1983 when Robert Alan Schwartz wrote an article on the subject for The Nation magazine. Between J. Edgar Hoover and John Hutchison, democratic rights didn’t stop with McCarthy’s downfall nor with the demise of so-called notorious J. Edgar Hoover. Yet for years, zero-point energy according to Hutchison is obtained from the quantum vacuum. Hutchison claims on scientific phenomena are regularly featured and discussed by various media coverage. John Hutchison's claims of inventions and discoveries of a variety of phenomena are, like, NASA. The FBI should do an article on NASA and their non-determinable webers.I do not find it too surprising Schwartz once more wrote about not only Frank Geyer, but Albert Einstein with not too much said about Carl P. Jung during these years around the turn of the centennial.	0|0|0|0|0|0
" Msa Garratts Hi,The idea about an article is a good one, but unfortunately you've started out with an error. That is understandable as the subject is complex. The WAGR first imported the M class Garratts, in 1911. These are very important locos, because they are the third class of Garratt to be built, and the first ""main line"" Garratt, showing the potential as a heavy freight hauler. They were followed up in 1912 by the Ms class, only difference being the Ms class were superheated. So they were also the first class of Garratts to be the subject of a repeat order. Both classes were built by Beyer-Peacock.The Msa class were constructed in 1930 by the WAGR in their own workshops. Apparently a copy of the Ms class, they did seem to have some cosmetic differences.The story does not end there, but moves to Victoria. The VR G class apparently is copied from the Ms class, the major difference is the frames moved outside so as to accomidate the reduced gauge. Outside framed Garratts are very rare, even in the smaller gauges. But wait there is more (no, not steak knives!). The design was used again, for the Australian Portland Cement's 3'6"" line near Geelong, the first loco being supplied in 1936 and the second in 1939. The boiler from one of these locos is used on the restored G42.So in conclusion the design was constructed over a period of 28 years, used on three railway, on two gauges and built by two manufacturers, with, if I've added it up correctly, 27 locos constructed.Personally I think the article should cover the history of the design, and include all the varients. Some work would be required to hunt down variations, though. So yes, I think it does deserve an article.Please feel free to use the above if you wish.Cheers,Michael."	0|0|0|0|0|0
Please pardon me if it's a stupid question, as I haven't really done a lot of work with categories in the past. But does that sort of change really need a CfD? I think that if I had found myself with a similar sub-cat idea, I would have just gone ahead and done it or, more likely, thrown it at a relevant project talk page to see if there were objections. Of course, maybe you weren't able to get consensus at the project, hence the post to CfD.

"Controversy:  Your point here is well taken but for the fact a person can be well aware of possible distinctions in terminology and still call a magazine a clip.  In actuality, it is the ""firearm experts"" that insist on a controversy by way of insisting on their terminology.  In other words, because they have taken issue with the layman's wording they have indeed made it controversial and not the other way around.  So while the distinction in wording may not be controversial within their circle of buddies they are in fact responsible for the controversy.  M-W Dictionary:  When I say ""the dictionary"" clearly I'm referring to ""the dictionary"" I cited before in this case M-W.  I am a ""cognitive miser"" like anyone that takes short cuts when I can, just as you shortened it to M-W.  Rather than grasp at straws in dissecting ones arguments let us focus on the big picture when we know what each other means.  I agree the dictionary isn't for giving an exhaustive description, that's what encyclopedias are for.  However in this instance it does shed some light on ""the controversy"" as it does indeed define a clip as also a magazine.  The reason for including it is not to give people a better understanding of the differences between types of clips or the different types of magazines.  The purpose of including it is to show the other side of the controversy and according to my research within Wikipedia this is entirely acceptable.  Agreement: Clearly some people don't agree with M-W just as you and I don't agree with SAAMI's statement that people sometimes refer to ""cartridge clips"" as ""magazines"".  The ""experts"" on weapon's have this fact somewhat backwards and are incorrect as they should state that people refer to ""magazines"" as ""clips"".  Just because you and I disagree with SAAMI's statement doesn't mean it should be taken out as a reference and I'd never suggest that.What I suggest is a compromise.  I agree with you about the references regarding Remington and Marlin as that does seem to fall under OR.  M-W however doesn't fall under OR as it is a published source and being a leader in its industry it could be argued is the authority on word use.  Do you have any suggestions on how it could be incorporated so as to show how this controversy is perpetuated?  Without saying it's wrong because it clearly isn't according to common usage.  I'm thinking something like this....Clip technically defined.....use to describe magazine is controversial....however M-W defines it as such.This allows readers to see their is a difference in terms, there is a controversy, and why it potentially exists or is perpetuated.  I think this is fair.  Note well that I never attempted to remove any sources that backed up what you're saying here.  I'm not interested in destroying your view, only presenting both sides fairly.

Possible imagesSo I just removed a huge Mate1 ad from the article, because in my opinion (although I believe it was added in good faith by User:KRW), it's inappropriate for an article about a general product or service to feature prominently the advertising or image of one single product within the class. Some examples I looked at included: Soft Drink where the main picture shows a variety of brands on a supermarket shelf (with a photo of the Diet Pepsi product line much lower down) Potato chip where two of the three pictures are of chips without packaging, and the third is a non-current ad Fast food where all of the food is shown unwrapped (and only the Big Mac is clearly identifiable), plus a nondescript interior photo and a photo of several adjacent restaurants Chocolate bar with an unwrapped chocolate bar shown.

, 27 April 2006 (UTC) The Game is an abstract mental game, the objective of which is to forget its existence. There is no point in calling The Game a meme, the majority of stuff on Wikipedia is a meme. A meme is simply any idea or concept. I think what this refers to is a common misconception of the word meme, basically meaning a fad. The Game has some interesting memetic properties, but these should be described elsewhere in the article if anywhere. Whoever wants the meme version up should read the meme article first.  11:04	0|0|0|0|0|0
"I think red tape accurately and succinctly communicates the situation you describe, especially given that in a prior version you yourself wroteAttempts to rectify this situation working through official channels did not workwhich it seems to me is the very essence of (extreme) red tape. If you like we can say instead official indifference or unresponsiveness, but I don't see how that better informs the reader.I also don't see how your wording makes the point you mention re success in decrypting and the importance of that success. Obviously a request for more resources will try to convince the recipient that such will help the writers to better do what they've been tasked to do. To spell out that their desire was ""to achieve the productivity that was possible"" would be completely superflous  of course that was the goal. And surely no reader needs to be told that better productivity / faster decrypting / etc. meant the entire difference between valuable intelligence and useless retrospective. Your wording doesn't mention any of that stuff anyway.Further (as I've said before) I also don't see why it matters what specific type of resource was lacking  the important points are: (a) the codebreakers felt that they could not do the best job possible without more resources; (b) Churchill unhesitatingly granted them carte blanche, showing the importance he attached to their work and the breadth of his authority in making such decisions. What doesn't matter is just what it was that was lacking  typists? paperclips? light bulbs?Some of these elements could be incorporated to enliven the narrative e.g. some kind of ""for want of a nail""-type angle  ""Look, Prime Minister, you've gathered all these first-class minds here but we can't get anything done because we have to do our own bloody TYPING!""  if sources lay something like that out.Am I missing something?

"None: Beefart repliesThanks for you comments. Few take the time to discuss grammar on Wikipedia and it shows in many articles. I disagree with you about 'none'. The word comes from the Old Norse ne an, which means, literally ""no one"". In my view, to get the sense of any usage of 'none' we must expand it in our minds to ""no one"". It is impossible to say ""no one are dinosaurs"". It has to be ""no one is a dinosaur"". Here are two examples from the OED: (E.J. Howard): Except for her eyes, none of her features was remarkable. (P. Rose): People sought her... but none was a companion. HOWEVER, the plot thickens, because the OED also gives this example from Graham Greene, who is highly regarded as a writer: None of our wives are invited. This flies in the face of the first two examples and suggests that the OED has given up the fight. Maybe I ought to as well ) ). There are of course some situations where expanding ""none"" to ""no one"" does not make any sense as either a singular or a plural. (e.g. None of the increase is due to...). Here the best we can hope for is to propose that ""none"" is a synonym for ""nothing"". I personally try to avoid expressions such as ""None of the increase"" and would be inclined to write ""No part of the increase""... "	0|0|0|0|0|0

You would be hoping that the listing of the RfC would bring in more contributors who might agree with you. It sounds like the current contributors want everything to be extremely well-sourced to respected scholarship, and they don't want anything said beyond what is known for sure.

Help clarify an artice: John Stark I was looking for information on John Stark and came across a confusing section. In the part about his early life, there is a paragraph that reads:On April 28, 1752, while on a hunting and trapping trip along the Baker River, a tributary of the Pemigewasset River, he was captured by Abenaki warriors and brought back to Canada but not before warning his brother William to paddle away in his canoe, though David Stinson was killed. While a prisoner of the Abenaki, he and his fellow prisoner Amos Eastman were made to run a gauntlet of warriors armed with sticks.The problem is that there is no mention of who David Stinson is, only that he was killed. I see that an edit you made (10:57, 2006 January 25‎) removed some clarification on him, instead identifying Amos Eastman as the fellow prisoner. As you have better knowledge on the subject, can you please put back some info identifying him? (or possibly remove the unclear info??)Thanks,	0|0|0|0|0|0

" The Truth about the 1986 Sinn Féin Ard Fheis The story of how Gerry Adams tried to turn an eighty year old revolutionary movement into a British Constitutional party.  How he broke the Sinn Féin constitution, created fake cumainn to give him fake votes and barred life long republicans from voting.  How he managed to expel himself and his supporters from Sinn Féin membership.  And, how a small band of republicans managed to keep the Sinn Féin constitution and traditional policy in tact. In 1986 Section 1b. of the Sinn Féin constitution read as follows:“No person who is a member of any political party organisation or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who, if elected, intend taking part in the proceedings of the Westminster or partitionist 26-County or 6-County  parliaments or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who sign any form or give any kind of written or verbal undertaking of intention to take their seats in these institutions, shall be admitted to membership or allowed to retain membership."" The Adams leadership put forward a motion, titled Resolution 162, at the 1986 Ard Fheis.  Its wording was as follows: RESOLUTION 162THAT this Ard-Fheis drops its abstentionist attitude to Leinster House. Successful Sinn Fein parliamentary candidates in 26-County elections:a. Shall attend Leinster House as directed by the Ard Chomhairle.b. Shall not draw their salaries for personal use. (Parliamentary representatives shall be paid a Sinn Fein organiser’s subsidy, and the Leinster House salary shall be divided at the direction of the Ard Chomhairle to defray national and constituency expenses.)To accommodate this change, the Constitution and Rules be amended as follows:That Section 1b of the Constitution be amended to read: No person who is a member of any political party organisation or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who, if elected, intend taking part in the proceedings of the Westminster or partitionist 6-County parliaments or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who sign any form or give any kind of written or verbal undertaking of intention to take their seats in these institutions, shall be admitted to membership or allowed to retain membership. Motion 162 supports and approves of the candidature of persons who, if  elected, would be of the intention to take their seats in certain circumstances i.e. on the direction of the Ard Chomhairle.  Obviously, Motion 162 infringes Section 1b.  Section 1b. was in effect at the time this Resolution was presented.  Its clear that Adams made a mistake in procedure.  He should have sought a majority decision to amend Section 1b. in 1986 and returned in 1987 to propose entering Leinster House.  Trying to amend Section 1b. and propose taking seats in the “partitionist 26-County Parliament” in the same Resolution was a logical impossibility. Can anybody say that  the wording:“That this Ard-Fheis drops its abstentionist attitude to Leinster House. Successful Sinn Fein parliamentary candidates in 26-County elections:a.  Shall attend Leinster House as directed by the Ard Chomhairle”does not constitute the supporting and approving of the candidature of persons who intend to take their seats in Leinster House as directed by the Ard Chomhairle?Clearly Adams was in breach of Section 1b. and according to that section he had expelled himself, and all those who voted for Resolution 162.Brian Feeney, in his book, Sinn Féin 100 Turbulent Years, puts forward the argument that Adams had managed to bypass Section 1b, by introducing a motion in 1983 allowing the “discussion” of any aspect of the Sinn Féin constitution.  This change may indeed have facilitated debate on abstentionism but it did not infringe on the content or effect of Section 1b in any way.  To discuss something is not the same as formally proposing or supporting it.  For example, conventions are held regularly where drug addiction is discussed without any of the delegates proposing or supporting it.  In fact the line Adams added in 1983 was superfluous, as the Sinn Féin constitution had never banned the “discussion” of anything – just the “approving” and “supporting” of taking seats in named partitionist parliaments.Of course its not illegal to amend or remove section 1b. Section 1b. bans the approval or support of candidates who intend to take seats in British assemblies. It can be removed or amended at any Ard Fheis by a two thirds majority. The reason for doing so could be many. Perhaps delegates might feel that it implies that they cannot be trusted to be loyal to the Republic. In fact its not necessary, according to the constitution, to give any reason. But you	0|0|0|0|0|0

" Section needs to be edited This line about New Hampshire is not very accurate:On January 17, 2000, for the first time, Martin Luther King Day was officially observed in all 50 states.[4] Prior to that New Hampshire and Arizona did not observe the day.In fact, New Hampshire passed ""Civil Rights Day"" in 1991, to honor Dr King, and other civil rights activists like Rosa Parks and Malcolm X.  Since the article states clearly that other states, such as Utah, have different names for the holiday, including combining it with Confederate military heroes, this sentence does not seem justifiable.  The article leaves the impression that New Hampshire was some sort of bigoted state, that was one of the last to recognize this holiday.I am a newbie to Wikipedia, how do we fix this?"	0|0|0|0|0|0

So, before posting please consider whether you might be described as a tendentious canvasser or drama seeker, mischief-maker, advocate, misrepresenter, someone who piles on without clue, or someone carrying over ""by association"" the disputes that they have with contributors elsewhere. If you might fall into one or more of those categories and still think it necessary to pass comment here then please try to find an admin to do that for you (and if you are an admin - Chillum comes to mind - then find another).

As for the picture of the Hinton, Wikipedia seemed to give me a hard time for trying to upload a photo unless I had explicit consent from the owner of the photo.  I had contacted Hinton previously to get some information from him personally, but I got the sense that I was annoying him slightly as he said he was really busy and was terse in his responses, so I decided not to pursue him for the picture.

Deletion of AV News page Just curious why the AV News page is being deleted while its primary competitor Antelope Valley Press is allowed to have its page here unmolested.Granted we have only been in business for six years but we are every bit as a legitimate news organization as AV Press and even more so than AV Town Crier, whose page is also allowed to be here I note.Here is the content:The AV News began as a weekly print newspaper with emphasis on local news located in Lancaster, California USA. It was the second largest circulating newspaper in the area after it began publishing in 2006. In 2008, the AV News added a website and in March 2010, much like the Seatte Post-Intelligencer, the AV News transitioned to a web-only publication. The AV News covers the Antelope Valley area of Los Angeles County - mainly the Palmdale/Lancaster Urbanized Area (a US Census Bureau defined term) and areas of north Los Angeles and southeastern Kern counties, including Acton, Agua Dulce, Edwards AFB, Lake Los Angeles, Mojave, Quartz Hill, Rosamond and Santa Clarita. The newspaper is conservative in its political stance. It is currently the official news publication of the Lancaster JetHawks, a minor league baseball team in Lancaster.HistoryThe AV News was founded by Fran Paolinelli in 2006. She continues to work at the publication today. It began as a weekly print publication before dropping its print version to become a web only publication at www.avnewsday.comThe paper, conservative leaning, holds strongly held views, which can become controversial at times.Competitors in its market are the Daily News, Antelope Valley Press and the Los Angeles Times.External linksAV News Official WebsiteThe format is the same as the AV Press. There is less historical info that the AV Press because we have only been going for six years and they've been up for decades. But still, we are getting e-mails from people who use Wiki to find out about the Lancaster/Palmdale area and are surprised to find out that there are more newspapers in the area than what they find listed.I also point out that the City of Lancaster is a major advertiser with us as is the local professional baseball team.Please info me as to what more I need to include so that our page will be left on site or restore the page.	0|0|0|0|0|0

His poorly thought out and executed statement affects his own credibility rather than mine. When asked for clarification of his accusation, he produces four links.

This has been done under the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article seems to be blatant advertising that only promotes a company, product, group, service or person and would need to be fundamentally rewritten in order to become an encyclopedia article. Please read the general criteria for speedy deletion, particularly item 11, as well as the guidelines on spam. If you can indicate why the subject of this article is not blatant advertising, you may contest the tagging. To do this, please add  on the top of Hash infotech and leave a note on the article's talk page explaining your position. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would help make it encyclopedic, as well as adding any citations from independent reliable sources to ensure that the article will be verifiable. Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this.	0|0|0|0|0|0
"{{unblock|DISCLAIMER: I do not identify as a Nazi, Neo-Nazi, Facist, Neo-Fascist. I do not accept or agree with the actions or views of Hitler or any other dictators in the world for that matter. I do not hate Jews... in fact I have many jewish friends...Hello, although this is technically an unblock appeal, it is really only a reason to explain.... you won't be in a mood to unblock me when I'm finished talking... )First of all I want to apologise, I should have thought before putting the giant swastika on my page. This is the reason for that... I have a few Jewish friends, and normally we sometimes make jokes about jews and christians and things like that. I never really make jokes about the holocaust, because that never go over well with them and it is not nice... well, apparently, a joke about jews being lawyers set one of my closest friends off who is not really a jew, but claims he is.... now he thinks I am a facist, nazi, and I hate jews.... i gotreally frustrated and annoyed and so I came home and started messing around on my userpage... Second of all, i would like to ask why it is not permissable to ""self identify as a nazi""? There are several userboxes dealing with this subject. There is even a userbox that states, ""This user identifies as a Hitlerist! WHAT THE HELL?!?!?! You will let people say they support Hitler, but you won't let them say they are nazis?!? Being a nazi does not mean that you condone Hitler or his actions, it simple means that you support the theory of the politics behind Nazism.... you can be a nazi and not support the horrible eugenics policy. But if you are hitlerist, that obviously says you support all that... your arguement would of course be that it is offensive to jews.... well if you are taking that into account, then you should also ban anyone that says they identify as a communist. That can be extremely offensive to christians... if you want me to, I can talk about all the horrible things they did to christians in communist russia (with reference of a nice book). I think I will... one of the things they did was putting shackles on the ankles and wrists of christians with spikes of the inside that cut into your skin if you moved at all... and then they put starved rats into your cell that tried to eat you alive so you had to fight them off while your wrists and ankles are killing you. They also tied you to a cross and hung you upside down over a huge pile of other prisoners crammed into a small room. You were then forced to excrete over everyone. You were also stood upright in a box while they drove long nails into it. It was alright if you stood perfectly still, but you would have to stand there for hours and then your body would sway and poke into the nails. They also stood you naked in a freezer with a doctor nearby that signalled when you were freezing to death and then they would take you out and warm you up. They would do that for hours on end. Then they would beat you over and over again asking you to renounce Christ... the holocaust was horrible, but I would rather be gassed or hung by a nazi than endure those tortures for 18 years like one man who wrote a book about his experiences... so could you ban all communists please? My last comment is in response to Chzz's question about me making the 'gay comment' statement. Nowadays the word gay is used for two meanings... one is homosexuality and the other is wierd, stupid, dumb... i was using the second connotation.... maybe if you people didn't spend so much time on this gay... sorry... stupid online encyclopedia you would realize how the real world uses words...Even if you unblock me (which you won't... )...) I will take a wikibreak... i don't want to become addicted to point of ruining my social life...... i have already recieved a punishment, never becoming an admin (the whole gay... sorry... dumb trust thing)... just know this... i would have enventually removed the swastika after I cooled down and because of your gay... sorry... dumb policy you have lost a serious editor... this whole thing has really annoyed me...  (P.S. Chzz, I have been on Wikipedia for 2 years... you think I forgot to sign my gay... sorry... stupid post? yeah right!))"	1|0|0|0|0|0

Respect for MedicaidI have to have alot of respect and admiration for the Medicaid system here in New York. I'm a client of a Medicaid Managed Care health plan through Capital District Physicians Health Plan. My plan is the result of a contract between CDPHP and the NY Medicaid system. Standard practice here is placing Medicaid clients in managed care plans through health insurance companies run by the state. I like my managed care plan. I was without any health care insurance for almost eight years, without Medicaid and my Medicaid Managed Care plan I'd be worse off. Better than nothing, isn't it?Oh, the name of my plan is CDPHP Select Plan, the plan CDPHP runs for Medicaid clients in my county and several other nearby counties.	0|0|0|0|0|0

If I wasn't a big grown up fella myself I suppose, from some of the passion in the comments directed at me, I might be getting close to feeling personally ""maligned"" myself - I might even question the evenhandedness of the administrators comments.  My sources have been questioned which is fair.  I have placed a query on the reliable sources discussion to show my willingness to be introspective and open to other  ideas; I suggest CliffC post a similar query for the 'How Drywall Works' article at that same notice board.

" ""GREEK CAPITAL LETTER YOT"" in Unicode 6.0.0 Newest Unicode 5.2.0 still features only small ""GREEK LETTER YOT"" () but misses big ""GREEK CAPITAL LETTER YOT"".

I explain that ""COMBINING DOT ABOVE"" is not suitable because it collides with ""GREEK CAPITAL LETTER IOTA"" glyph by partial overlapping with it. Avoiding of fixing of this problem is already long overdue, because many font designers are using for ""GREEK CAPITAL LETTER YOT"" illegal codepoints, for example:Vusillus font uses illegal U+03F5 for ""GREEK CAPITAL LETTER YOT"", which conflicts with official ""GREEK LUNATE EPSILON SYMBOL""New Athena Unicode uses illegal U+03FF for ""GREEK CAPITAL LETTER YOT"", which conflicts with official ""GREEK CAPITAL REVERSED DOTTED LUNATE SIGMA SYMBOL""As you see, this confusion must be ended as soon as possible. 78.46.51.229  "	0|0|0|0|0|0

I have an idea that would allow people to view various prospects for Scott Weilands replacement in an easier way rather than just posting sentences in the ""Split from Weiland"" section... How about someone ends the ""Split..."" section with a closing paragraph about Scott leaving and then they form a new section titled something like: ""Rumored replacement singers"" or something like that. And that section can have an opening statement saying ""Numerous individuals have been considered for scott weilands replacement; they include:"" and then below, write a list of every person who has been rumored.It is easier to find names rather than searching through a section of the article that doesnt even have a title relevant to the fact that VR is looking for a new singer...Anyways, please let me know what you think on this idea...

Annual murder rate per million: Indians in India =34, All Australians in Oz=11, Indians in Oz=25. The official explanation for the higher rate for Indians in oz compared with all Australians is that they are much more likely to be young and male, and about half of all violent crime involves young males. Unofficially I would point out that if you eliminate Indian murders by Indians in Oz then suddenly the difference gets much smaller. So it is pretty damn simple, Indians murder each other wherever they are. Please do something about it if you care.	0|0|0|0|0|0

Under such criteria, you better be inserting notability templates into each and every unsourced article that exists.  Since we have had unsourced BLPs in Wikipedia for years, that is not sufficient criteria for determining if something is notable or not. The standard is if such could be found. There are already several sources in the article about several European groups in Mexico such as the Mennonites and Spanish refugees. Could the article be improved? Definitely. But notability is not an issue except to those who beleive that Europeans or whites do not (or better stated, should not) exist in Latin America.	0|0|0|0|0|0

Actually, I'm in complete agreement with you about the picture caption, sorry I wasn't more clear.I know that in dye lasers it's often common to have a filter tube around the lamp, usually just for water flow, to absorb the NIR before it causes thermal shock in the liquid. I'll look into this more.Thanks for your explanation of spectralon, as that makes a great deal of sense. Yes, it would've been helpful if the article had not been deleted. It is often helpful to include a small parenthetical explanation of specialized words anyway. I can see where using a polished and AR coated rod would be beneficial in such a cavity, coupling more light than difussing it through the surface of the rod. I know from sad experience that keeping the light diffused either way is almost a necessity, to keep the rod from cracking. -{ I believe I also read that on the Kentek website, and in one of the most accurate sources I've found on lasers, Principles of Lasers by Oratio Svelto, although the book is a little difficult to follow as 80% of it is written in math.Anyhow, thanks again for all of your assistance -D	0|0|0|0|0|0

We should not have religious beliefs, evolution or creationist beliefs brought into wikipedia on edits. We need a nice neautral position not in favour of any of them, sticking to objective data and not subjective viewpoints. The user in dicussion here deals with subjectivity only, anything which opposes his own faith - is deleted, reverted etc. I can not bring this up anymore this is all he does on wikipedia confirmed by his history. The user in question is your best friend fair play. If there was a conscience at play here someone would do something about it, but nobody else is looking into this except yourself, so you will obviously win this by position of authority winning as i could easily obtain a ban, this place is not neutral, i will stay inactive for a year and come back later when things are more fair on here.	0|0|0|0|0|0

"Again, I disagree. Scholarly consensus has been moving towards the direction of inclusiveness (particularly for the question of the Roma and the disable). In fact, as you go through modern academic literature (the last 20 years), ""Holocaust"" more and more includes non-Jewish victims. Just an example: Alex Callinicos, from York University, (2001) The Holocaust isfor good reasons I need not rehearse heregenerally held to be the most extreme case of human evil. All the different kinds of domination fused together in Auschwitzracism, directed at Jews, Slavs, and Roma; the economic exploitation of slave labour; the oppression of gays and women; the persecution of dissenting minorities such as Communists and Jehovah's Witnesses. Or Slawomir Kapralski, ""Identity Building and the Holocaust: Roma Political Nationalism."" I have already mentioned Sybil Milton (who was a senior historian at the Research Institute of the US Holocaust Memorial Museum), and Henry Friedlander, a leading Holocaust historian in the USA, is another important voice. This increasing consensus has had an impact on common language , as well on political bodies. See this press release from the UN, for instance. It is not a question of ranking victimsit is the concept of hte holocaust as a racist, mordern project, and the common fate of the victims. The famous pictures of Mengele's twins are of Roma children. The technology and expertise for mass murder was developed for the disable in the T4. The tactics of Eisengruppen were first developed in the invasion of Poland, against Polish leaders. I have seen several good arguments that convinced me of the centrality of Jews in the Holocaust; I have never seen a convincing argument for their exclusivity.If this is not enough, let me try in another way: by deciding to describe the Holocaust as an 'exclusive' Jewish event, wikipedia is taking sides in a ongoing scholarly debate (I could say on the 'declining' side of an ongoing scholarly debate). this is NOT holocaust denial, with no legitimacy in the academia, and it must receive more than mere lip service in the body of the text or in the footnotes. At very least Wikipedia must admit the existence of debate in the lead "	0|0|0|0|0|0

You make some good points. While Begley's piece is a reliable source, I agree that it's problematic to give such prominence to her opinion. You always end up with questions of why this commentator is being cited rather than that commentator. However, when all this is finally over next week with Muir Russell's report, I think we need an overview of where opinion stands. It certainly seems to be trending towards Begley's view that it's a manufactured controversy with no substance to it. I suggest taking Begley out of the lead, and out of the article altogether for now, and then re-adding her view as part of a summary of post-Muir Russell opinion.	0|0|0|0|0|0

Sadly for you it's only now that you've realised what they really mean! REAL Pathans have known all along (as you can tell from the Pashto proverbs) that language and culture can be lost and acquired, but being able to trace yourself to the Geneolgical tree of the Pathans is what eventually counts regardless of everything - hence the reason why there are so many proverbs on this subject.

Here's the quote:Let me give this an example, let's say I'm talking about the 2004 US Presidential Election. Suppose I say this:""Only 60 million Americans (out of the 300 million Americans total) voted to re-elect President Bush."" This sentence is technically true, and it is technically factual, but it is also misleading and unfair to President Bush. The sentence implies that while only 60 million supported the President, the other 240 million didn't vote for him. This is technically true, but it's totally unfair and misleading. The fact is, most American's don't vote, and the majority of those 300 million were ""undecided"", not ""opposed to Bush"". And as we know, Bush was, in fact, the most popular candidate. So to say ""60 million out of 300 million total supported Bush"" is simply very, very misleading even if every word of it happens to be true.So saying others with different policies are opposed to BSAis the same kind inferrence some were vehemently against.  ;-)  "	0|0|0|0|0|0

" UFC AFDs Those were never transcluded to the AfD page so there's probably not a lot of point them existing.  I'm a bit pushed for time today, so if you want to remove the AfD banners from the articles, I'll delete the AfD pages when I get the chance.   I haven't been able to spend much time on Wikipedia lately.  Looks like they've been ""officially"" listed as AfDs.  I'll leave them alone for now.     Jake Bostwick I've only nominated a few, very obvious MMA people before.  Bostwick was deleted via AfD discussion.  A speedy delete on grounds of it being deleted before was denied.  To me, he still fails WP:MMANOT, but I'm in no way a MMA expert.  What do you think?   At first glance it appears that Bostwick hasn't fought at the ""highest level"" of MMA as required by WP:ATHLETE (or whatever the guideline is these days) and WP:MMANOT.  If I had an interest in having the article removed, I would AfD it again.    Hello, It has been brought to my attention from an outside source about this discussion. Can I first point out that Jake Bostwick is a former UCMMA middleweight champion and currently the UCMMA welterweight champion? UCMMA is, along with BAMMA and Cage Warriors, the biggest MMA promotion in the United Kingdom. Secondly, after glancing over WP:MMANOT and WP:ATHLETE, I see that they are indeed guidelines. Now I may be cut from a different cloth from you two in terms of how we see what a guideline is but to me, a guideline is optional when it comes to following it, meaning that they cannot be used in AfDs as the sole reason why to delete any article. Thirdly, I have spent much time working on the page (as well as being the creator of the page), I have found very strong sources from websites such as The Sun, The Mirror as well as finding information that goes beyond it from being a 'typical' mixed martial artist's Wikipedia page, as it has information about him being on a reality tv show called Party Wars, and being the headline of an article in which he got into issues with the police for his tactics whilst working as a Wheel Clamper only strengthens his notability. The very sources on him alone helps him pass WP:GNG, which is all you need to pass a page on Wikipedia in my opinion.I would welcome constructive ideas about improving the page even more, but to talk about deleting the page without informing me first of this discussion I find is a bit disrespectful towards me, however I fairness to you we haven't exactly known each other for a while, so now I have adding myself to the topic and given the facts of the page's position on Wikipedia, now we can talk to help improve the page even more.    User:Pound4Pound Since you filed the SPI, I wanted to update you that I've reversed the block.  I requested another editor to review the case, and while there are a lot of coincidences, he felt it was borderline enough based on behavior, that the block should be reversed and instead just monitor the situation.  I had some reservations going into the block, but it seemed likely, however, I fully respect the review and would ask we all give the benefit of the doubt in this case.

"Anyone have any thoughts on the addition of Bernard Lonergan to the list of notable metaphysicians?  Since Augustine, Aquinas are listed and Lonergan is clearly in this trajectory of Catholic philosophers, I thought he would be a good addition to the list. His work is well-regarded in 20th century philosophy, he certainly has the credentials, and I think many would agree he made highly significant contributions to metaphysics by extending the core ideas of Aristotle, Augustine and Aquinas forward in the areas of cognitional theory, epistemology and verifiable metaphysics based on the ""data of consciousness"" and his study of methodology in mathematics and empirical science. see Insight: A study of Human Understanding. There are Lonergan Centers at Boston College, University of Toronto, Seton Hall, and Loyola Marymount University devoted to studying and extending his works in philosophy and theology. I'm quite sure nearly every philosophy professor at any Jesuit schools would consider his work ""notable"".My attempt at this addition was reverted as ""not particularly notable as a metaphysician"" so  thought I would throw it out there.

Thanks for replying. Off hand, I'm not convinced that investigating your reply wizard and how it works would have speeded up this conversation.I checked the deletion log before querying this with you. It merely refers to criteria F7, invalid fair use claim, without any further explanation of exactly why, as you have now given.In this instance the stamp image is not used simply as an illustration, where as per policy an alternative illustration (for example, by scanning the covers and creating a similar collage) could have been created. It also makes an important contribution to the discussion of the series, by demonstrating that it is sufficiently important for a stamp to have been created depicting the series as a whole. The existence of the stamp itself is noteable for a mention in the article.I note that criteria 2.1.3 is not a wiki policy but merely a guideline, and is stated to be one example of acceptable usage, not an exhaustive list. The policy above states that usage must follow the spirit of the policy at the top of the page, not the guideline list of examples.Regards.	0|0|0|0|0|0

"Well, in case anyone's interested in following up on this further, using the La Trobe University on-line search engine, a search for the term mahāpurisalakkhaṇ (truncated to allow for various inflections) leads to 77 (BJT) record hits, at least 65 of which are in the Pali Canon.  Here's the first page of the search results (with links to the subsequent pages as well):  http://www.chaf.lib.latrobe.edu.au/dcd/pitikaresults.php?title=&start;=60&to;=70&searchstring;=mahāpurisalakkhaṇ .  Of course, this is by no means a straightforward indicator of how many discourses actually reference this term (nor what this term means in the context of various suttas) since multiple records can be part of a single sutta.  (Similarly, this is not a clear reflection of the total number of times that this term appears in the Pali literature as a single record could have multiple instances of the term and their might be other ways of formulating this phrase not addressed by the above truncated compound term, etc.).  FWIW, a quick review of these results (potentially suggestive of the distribution of this term in the various nikayas) shows 40 hits in the Digha Nikaya, 15 in the Majjhima Nikaya, none in the Samyutta Nikaya, 3 in the Anguttara Nikaya, and 7 in the ""canonical"" Khuddaka Nikaya (mostly in the Suttanipata), 5 in the paracanonical KN words (e.g., Netti, Peta), one in the Abhidhamma's Kathavatthu, once in the Visuddhimagga, and 5 times in the Pali histories.

" as daft as it sounds yes, if it cant be verified it gets removed plain and simple i suggest you reread these core wikipedia policies wp:truth wp:verifable wp:rs wp:nor and wp:nor i hav enot intentions in edit warring with you over it but be warned since it isnt sourced anyone can remove it and report you for vandelism. (talk - contrib)  (As it says on my talk page, I prefer to have discussions all in the same place. I am watching this page, so please reply here. To this end I have taken the liberty of moving your previous reply here.) So if I add a statement that there are no vacuum tubes in SSDs either, you'll insist on a source for that too?  Seriously, you are mistaken on a few points. I think you need to read WP:VERIFY yourself:   All material in Wikipedia mainspace, including everything in articles, lists and captions, must be verifiable. All quotations and any material whose verifiability has been challenged or is likely to be challenged, must include an inline citation that directly supports the material. Any material that needs a source but does not have one may be removed. (emphasis added - jeh)  Note the distinction. You wrote ""if it can't be verified it gets removed"". But, first, the claim that SSDs contain no disks obviously can be verified. Not only is it part of the definition of the term, the very first reference in that very article confirms this claim in its description of these devices. So, no, we don't need to cite a source for this particular instance of the claim.  And second, except for BLP issues, WP:V only states that unsourced material that needs a source may be removed. This material didn't need a source, and even if it did, it isn't required to remove it right away. Even for claims that really should have a citation to a WP:RS, the polite and widely accepted thing to do is to add a ""citation needed"" template. See template:cn. This is a much less abrasive thing to do to someone's edit rather than simply reverting it.  I suppose you could say ""well, since I removed it, its verifiability has been challenged so now it does require a source."" Yeah, fine. So I go to the work of adding a reference name to one of the refs that's already there, and then cite that same ref from my new text as well. No, it's not much work, but consider: Does it really improve the article to add a reference footnote number to a statement that is as obviously true as this one? Is adding that little footnote number really the best use of my time here? Was it the best use of yours? And will this little challenge you raised over a completely trivial edit and obvious claim make me feel more or less eager to contribute to WP in the future?  Also: In my edit I merely noted that despite the term ""solid state disk"" there are no actual ""disks"" inside these devices. In your edit comment you said ""since they refer to it is a disk we must to [sic]"". Well, that is true, but my edit did not remove any reference to the terms ""solid state disk"" or ""electronic disk"" from the article, nor even claim that such were wrong. So your edit comment was off point and provided no valid justification for your action.  Finally, I must point out that you are wrong about vandalism. The fact is that edits made in good faith are not generally considered vandalism. After reading WP:VERIFY you should probably look at WP:VANDALISM:Even if misguided, willfully against consensus, or disruptive, any good-faith effort to improve the encyclopedia is not vandalism. Edit warring over content is not vandalism. Careful consideration may be required to differentiate between edits that are beneficial, detrimental but well-intentioned, and vandalizing. Mislabelling good-faith edits as vandalism can be considered harmful. (emphasis added - jeh) You should probably also read WP:AGF to see what ""good faith"" means and what you are supposed to do about assuming it.   In sum: Please be careful about undo'ing others' edits until you are more familiar with the actual prescriptions of things like WP:VERIFY. Consider using the CN template rather than reverting unsourced material. Please think carefully before tossing around words like ""vandalism"".  And you should never have ""intentions of edit-warring"", so the statement that you don't have any here is troubling.

Where'd they go? The omission of the Klamath Mountains is probably a bit of a shock to California geomorphologists and geologists, but it will be welcomed by beginning California geology students.  The Coast Ranges are bad enough without having to figure out that thing about the Sierra Nevadamaking them all one is nice, but it should say bounded by the Sierra Nevada on the east and north, I suppose.Bounded by the Cascade Range to the north, the Sierra Nevada to the east, the Tehachapi Mountains to the south, and the Coast Ranges and San Francisco Bay to the west, the valley is a vast agricultural region drained by the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers.I'd ask for a fact check or something, but I'd be banned by the community for questioning a fact.

" MediaWiki:Duplicate-defaultsort Do you realize what a wonderful thing this is?  When you created it eight weeks ago was it your intention to address the conflict that pupped up in the category it created?  I hope not because I have been, although if you want to jump in and take care of the ones under ""S"" and ""T"" while I finish ""L"" and do ""M"" through ""R"" I will not complain.When I stumbled across the category there were 2,777 pages in it.  By the end of today there will be fewer than 1,000.  My goal is to get all the non-trivial items resolved by the end of next week so I can start on the pages in Category:Biography articles without listas parameter, a project that should keep me out of trouble for the rest of my life.  Because I am resolving the conflicts in the first category I have learned more about how banners work than probably anyone else except the folks, like you, who know why the banners work as they do.  I have also leaned what items can set the DEFAULTSORT. As an added bonus I have leaned a couple of keyboard shortcuts I did not know before and I have become almost addicted to Preview.The absolutely best part about the Dup-DS is that the category it has created, that I will continue to monitor on a daily basis, is a safety net for me when I mess something up on a page in  Category:Biography articles without listas parameter.  The easiest error to make is for me to neglect to put a listas value in a template that uses it, wants it, and will throw a fit if it is not there.Thank you!  "	0|0|0|0|0|0

"xkcdHey!  A fan pointed me over to where you had deleted the line about my working for NASA from the short article on me (Randall Munroe), labeling it ""patently made-up information"".  Understandable and taken in good humor, of course, and nothing on the page is sourced (it's more of a stub than anything).  But I'm curious why you were so sure it was fabricated.  )  xkcdI find it hard to believe that a 22-year-old could have been working full-time for NASA. Of course, you may well be freakishly gifted and the kind of person that NASA would have been all over, but it just seems ever so slightly hard to believe.  - Schreit mich an I interned there during college and started working for them a bit before I graduated.  I stayed for the better part of a year until late 2006.  NASA is a huge organization with a tremendous number of contract positions on all sorts of projects.  It's not all rocket scientists leaning over mission control screens and talking to astronauts on their headsets.Anyway, the information is taken from my published bio page, but you're right  you have no way of knowing whether I'm lying or not.  I guess it's probably safest to assume that I am.In that case, I'll admit my mistake and congratulate you on interning and working in a pretty impressive place (I know very little about science, but anyone who got to work for NASA has got to be a smart cookie in that kind of area). Feel free to re-add the info, although the impression I got from the original version was more than you weren't just a contract worker. If that's not even a valid distinction in the States - it's increasingly less of one here in Oz - then my apologies there in advance.  - Schreit mich an  Honestly, they never really explained to me which one I was.  I went to work every day in a building at NASA where I worked on NASA robots, and NASA paid me (through a government contractor).  When I said ""I work for NASA"" no one argued. It was a lot more Dilbert-esque than you would expect.  Old, echoing tile hallways with quiet, gruff middle-aged men working at blueprint-covered desks, mild office politics, lots of presentations and buzzwords, and hours spent wading through computer code trying to figure out why the motor on the lab bench was spinning the wrong way.  I thought it sounded like the perfect place to work, and it was good in a lot of ways, but I was happy to leave.  xkcd Can you nominate my entry Hey BigHaz, can you please show me how the nomination process goes for DYK, I mean is it nominated the same way like featured articles are nominated. Actually, this thing is new to me. Thanks  Sure thing. The way it works is that your nomination which you made is called the ""hook"". That gets put onto the Suggestions page, which I'll move it to in a moment. Over the next few days, people will make various comments about it - if the ""hook"" is too long, if it needs sources, whatever else. If you're able to respond to those comments (if there are any made), then your article might get selected.  - Schreit mich an  By suggestion pages you mean to say talk pages or what    It's not easy to do that, since the suggestions are cleared from the page after they get onto the front page, so I really can't just point you to a page and say ""here you are"". What particularly do you want to see? If you're after examples of the kinds of comments people make, just keep an eye on the Suggestions page.  - Schreit mich an Caucasian ethnicitiessemites are caucasian.  Or indeed not. See, for example, Semitic, which clearly indicates otherwise. They speak wildly different languages to those spoken by Indo-European people (who are the ones we normally call ""Caucasian""), so unless there's some startling new research out there, I don't think that comment is accurate.  - Schreit mich an I'm not even going to dignify this with a response.

I don't want anything in this article that isn't specific to Rushton's book including generic comments by Gil-White that don't address Rushton in particular and certainly not his book. Just because Gil-White mentions Rushton elsewhere in his book does not justify putting a completely separate criticism of race theories in general in section to devoted to criticism of his book.  If you insist upon putting in generic critiques against race in general, I'll insist on putting in references that defend race in general.  People come here not to read about the race debate in general, but about this specific book and the response it got. I have no problem with the Native American argument if it can be cited as a critique against this book, but for now it's an orginal argument composed by wikipedia editors.	0|0|0|0|0|0

"History of Primal Therapy articleI read through the recent discussions on Talk:Primal_therapy. I also added two more comments to the Talk:Arthur_Janov page. Did you send an email enquiry? The 1973 date for France D's marriage to Art is without credibility. After the divorce, to Vivian's great credit, she avoided the temptation to publicly humiliate Arthur Janov. After all, he wrote in the original Primal Scream: ""It is instructive to note that married couples who have both gone through Primal Therapy have never separated."" (chapter 12). And according to France D. Janov's own admission in the Primal Center's Video Series 2, she enrolled at the Primal Institute because excessive marihuana use had broken down her gates. So it's a fact that Art married a former patient.My feeling is that despite being tagged as a stub, the content of the Arthur Janov article is just about right for an encyclopedia entry. It isn't really the place to dissect Janov's reputation. I know it happens in other Wikipedia biographies, but in many cases it has got out of hand. I agree with your suggestion on the Primal therapy Talk page that this kind of material belongs in a separate History of Primal Therapy article. The Conocer piece doesn't strike me as a sound source of verifiable information, so I put together some links to articles which can be found online:If you type Emotional Intelligence into Google the No.1 result is Steve Hein's eqi.org website. He interviewed a former patient who attended Arthur Janov's Primal Center in the late 1990's. You can find his interview notes here, labelled ""cautionary note"".Janov's bio on the Primal Center website states: ""The latest research conducted at Dr. Janov’s Primal Center on the effects of Primal Therapy on the brain was performed by Dr. Erik Hoffman, former Professor of Neurophysiology at Copenhagen University."" You can read  what Erik Hoffmann, Ph.D., is doing now at Hoffmann's website.On this page you can find a transcript of Dr. E. Michael Holden's account of what happened to him after he left the Primal Institute.Carol Mither's book, Therapy Gone Mad, identifies case histories from Janov's first two books that were written by defendants in the lawsuits against The Center for Feeling Therapy.  Simon ( )Thanks, Simon - Why can't you create an account like normal Wikipedians complete with a talk page? I don't think the History idea will come to much, There is just insufficient well sourced information to make much out of it - especially in view of Cgingold's latest analyses on the Primal Therapy talk page regarding derogatory statements about living individuals. I have already read the Michael Holden swan song twice - sad case.  You seem to be applying two standards of evidence. The Primal Therapy article gives an outline of primal theory based on Arthur Janov's books alone, which were written to attract paying customers to his exclusive and expensive private treatment center. Last September, I wrote in the Primal Therapy talk page: Will the article have something to offer readers who want to know about Stettbacher's method, or the International Primal Association, or the plethora of copycat primal centers that flourished in the 1970s? There is sufficient well sourced information available for a history article  for a start, two books about The Center for Feeling Therapy, Erik Hoffmann's bio, and the transcript of Dr. E. Michael Holden's audio tape which was played a number of times at the IPA convention in 1983. The books by Carol Mithers and Tomas Videgård are already referenced in the main article. I have a copy of Videgård's book, by the way. Also, Professor Steven Rose wrote a one-page account of his research with Arthur Janov in Lifelines:""As Janov had hoped, it turned out that before therapy, the quantity of these particular receptors in his client's platelets was considerably below normal. Within six months of therapy, clients' depression had lifted, and the biochemical and immunological measures I was making approached the average for 'normal' non-depressed people of the same age and sex.""Further down the same page he added:""I obtained similar biochemical results when, a couple of years later, I did a similar study with depressed clients going through other, less dramatic forms of psychotherapy, so I suspect that in such cases the therapist matters more than the therapeutic theory.""Having participated in the editing of articles in t	0|0|0|0|0|0

" Yeah I think general summaries are ok as long as they are actual summaries of multiple authors, aren't just mere repetitions of the author's statement and don't elongate the paragraph more unnecessarily. Also I'll like to point out these mistakes in your comment:""2) per Eliade, approximative understanding, partly of apparently non-Arabian rites, so not much;""Eildae never says it was non-Arabian. She's talking about Monophysite rites and Monophysite was the largest branch of Christianity in Arabia. ""3) per Watt, details that may be surmised by close analysis Muhammad's life;""He also argues that these verses might be attacking Christian heresies rather than orthodox beliefs. Also in the final I'll like to say again the subject of the article isn't about Quran and it's historicity and interpretations. So adding more and more unnecessary arguments and interpretations makes the paragraph stray too far from the topic and unnecessarily elongates the paragraph with needless irrelevant text.

Actually, fibromyalgia is not a syndrome per se.  Fibromyalgia Syndrome is a syndrome.  The primary document for the classification of fibromyalgia upon wch the de facto diagnostic criteria are derived states there are two defining criteria, i.e. chronic widespread pain and pain on palpation.  The comorbid symptoms that characterize the syndrome are not part of the classification of FM per se.

" Trimming sounds fine, but where a dispute comes up, I would recommend slowing things down.  Focus on one or two specific quotes, and if someone reverts, instead of immediately reverting back, try to come up with a compromise version.  Ditto with the other person reverting, instead of immediately pushing the article back to your own preferred version, try to come up with a compromise.  With each person changing each other's work, rather than reverting, it will probably be much easier to try and come up with a consensus version. Also, use clear, calm, and neutral edit summaries, referring strictly to the article, and not the editors. In terms of refactoring, what I was referring to was cases where a particular editor was being referred to.  When a post is phrased such as ""You did this wrong"" or ""He is unwilling"" or ""He's just always stubborn"", then that's getting away from discussing the article content, and is veering off into discussing the editors.  Better is to try and phrase talkpage posts without referring to editors.  Good habits to develop (though they can take  time to get the hang of it), are to avoid the words ""you"" and ""your"". Also, avoid naming specific editors in a post, as that often has the immediate result of making someone defensive, and then they may miss everything else that's said. Instead, when it is necessary to refer to a specific thing that was done, diff the edit without mentioning the editor.  Like, ""I disagree with this edit (diff), as I feel it's a violation of (policy/guideline).  A better way to handle things would be (suggestion)""  I know it may sound a bit confusing to do this, but I have seen that using this kind of third-party discussion technique, can work wonders in de-escalating disputes.  It also tends to make whoever is using the technique, sound extraordinarily calm and thoughtful, even if off-wiki they may be hopping mad. ) It also has the added benefit of making things much easier for administrators to take action.  When an uninvolved admin comes to a page in dispute, and they see everyone yelling at each other, the admin normally assumes that everyone is a bit in the wrong.  The admin won't care ""who started it"", they'll just address things as they see them in that moment.  But if an admin comes to a page and sees five editors discussing things calmly, and one editor being uncivil, then it makes it much easier to figure out how to reduce the disruption.  Caveat: Just because one editor is being uncivil, doesn't necessarily mean that they're in the wrong.  But if the discussion has degraded to the point where all they're doing is name-calling, rather than actually discussing the article, then that's a problem that an administrator can easily address, by removing the non-constructive editors from the discussion. onka "	0|0|0|0|0|0

It was not my intent to editorialize the article on Marcel Lefebvre, but I was trying to correct and add some information about him.  I did that because that article seemed to be slanted towards a pro-Lefebvre position as well.  I felt that it did not have enough information to give people the chance to make an accurate assessment about Lefebvre.  The two people who I called arch conservative were exactly that.  Both men tried to derail the Second Vatican Council, and fought both John XXIII and Paul VI and all those who were in favor of reform every step of the way.  I don't know if Thomas Jefferson actually said this or not, it was a quote the Jefferson character made in the movie 1776 that he felt that King George III was a tyrant even if they did not include call him a tyrant in the Declaration of Independance, so he thought they might as well call him a tyrant.  And I have talked to Catholics who were treated rather badly by church officals - especially in the times before the Second Vatican Council.  Why do you think that sexual abuse of children became such a crisis for the church?  It was because of a long standing church policy to protect the clergy at the expense of the laity.  I remember talking to an older gentleman whose grandfather left the church for a while, he didn't exactly what his grandfater's reasons were, but he said it probably wasn't hard to guess why.Even if people were supressing the faults of the new mass, it appears to me that the pendelum swung the other way, that the article was stuffed full of criticism on the new mass, but anything on the benefits was totally removed from this article.  That's why I added the tag, because what I read gave me cause to believe that this article was slanted in one direction. 02:56, 4 Jun 2004 (UTC)	0|0|0|0|0|0

""Summary of operations""To the newcomers in this discussion and also to the selective forgetful ones:See above The heart of this Case;As well as the sections Spurious Quotations, Once Again, and sections Warning to Judge by yourselves II in my Talk Page;To note that 1) from grammatical objections to the size of version that I propose, no one objection was left standing and even so it continues to be reversed, even taking into account that the present version: incurs spurious quote in the 1st paragraph, too detailed and redundant information (for an article that are supposed to be short...) on the 2nd paragraph, and incomplete besides be longer, vague and non neutral in the 3rd...2) How not to think in double standard when:The last disruptive revertion, besides be longer than the version I propose, was based entirely on incorrect inferences and historical misconceptions as I shown above (again... See above points A to E in ""Once Again"" section ) that were related only to the 2nd paragraph (of the version I propose);and thatNo word was uttered against or about the spuriousness that was purged of the 1st paragraph, as well as against or about the 3rd paragraph, that according to some editor (Ctr F on word ""solid"" to see above, on the discussion about grammar in the ""Once Again"" section), was ""pretty solid""...And even so, the revertion was done...So, I again ask you all:1) Is the spuriousness justifiable under any circunstances?2) In the case of an encyclopedia that is intended to be free and neutral, which group of honest editors would admit the use of partial referrals that lead to political and historical inferences in favor of a political regime (monarchical, military, etc.) whatever be?Worse, which group of honest editors would allow the use of spurious citations of a partial source for purposes mentioned above - even if this purposes are involuntary, although the time that passed without actions having been taken, as well as the resistance to remediation maintained, only makes this possibility (of involuntariness) unlikely???3) Which group of honest editors, ladies and gentlemen, who were truly committed to the freedom and neutrality of such instrument, would vote against such remediation or would omit about it?

Roazir; Fars is the Arabic version of Pars, the Iranian name when translated to English is “the Gulf of Pars” and the English name “Persian Gulf” means exactly the same thing, Interestingly enough most Gulfs in the world are called like the Iranian name for e.g. Gulf of Mexico, Gulf of Aden, Gulf of Carpentaria, Gulf of the Farallones, Gulf of Maine, Gulf of Tonkin, Gulf of Guinea, etc, etc, so the correct name for the Persian Gulf should have been “the Gulf Of Pars” just as the Iranian name is! As for the Azarbaijan, as both versions already exist on the Wiki and we are not inventing a new name, I insist on using the one that is recognised by the majority of the people in the region. The whole population of Rep Azerbaijan is less than 10% of the population of Iran (let alone other countries in the region who write and pronounce the word  Azarbaijan like Iranians do) so why a vast majority should follow a small minority? It is Azarbaijan and English speaking people better get used to it!	0|0|0|0|0|0

Thanks Moonriddengirl. Wikidea, I'm sure you're an excellent lawyer, and I admire your goal to turn Wikipedia into a superior reference work for law students - it's one I share, with one amendment. Wikipedia is not a legal resource for lawyers and law students. It is not a casebook. It is not a practitioner's text. It is a work for the laypeople, to explain as simply as possible (in this case) how the law works. That's what you should aspire to with your articles, and it's what I aspire to with mine. The layperson is more helped by third-party references and summaries than (to them) unintelligible case citations and full body quotations from judgments. While such quotations and citations have their place (this, I feel, uses such case citations well, but I might be a teensy bit biased) they are the obiter, not the ratio.	0|0|0|0|0|0

Peanut butter (if placed in the category of a 'nut butter') is also in the category if 'butter substitute' but it is not a type of margarine, which is what this product is.

Big cleanup needed Obviously, this article needs a bit of work.  As I see it, we need two things: sections within the list, and inclusion criteria.On sectioning, I believe that we would do well initially in making two sections: Proposed systems, and systems that actually made it to production.On inclusion criteria, I recommend that we limit it to launch systems that have articles.  Some proposed launch systems simply aren't notable.  So they don't get included here.So there you go, I suppose.   (Talk)	0|0|0|0|0|0

Hi. We have three members already. We all seem interested in the project. I have created a template to place on article's talk pages. An user from the Spanish WikiProject has just suggested that we translate articles from one Wikipedia to the other using an automatic translator, but no-one responded yet. One of the members is interested in writing about gay literature, and there has been somewhat of a discussion about whether it should be gay literature or LGBT literature. I believe this was the first discussion of the project. Two of us think that LGBT literature would be best. I don't have a lot of time to dedicate to the project, so I would like it if it didn't depend on me to survive and grow and be successful. The other two members have asked what they can do for the project. I would like to write something to better explain what a Wiki Project is for, because this seems unclear. I believe it's not much of a big deal, it's just a way to have all people interested in the same subject in the same place, so if something important happens concerning that subject (for example a page gets nominated for deletion), all interested people get to know. It should also create a sense of community, and it's good to have that since we'll be editing the same articles. I think things are going fine, except that I don't know whether the other members see this as I do.	0|0|0|0|0|0

" Naji al-Ali Hi Ian,I noticed you changed the date of birth cited on this page to 1938. What is your source for that? I'm wondering because the Arabic wikipedia article, which this page started as a translation from, cites his year of birth as 1937, while a book I have about him - the one referenced in the article - cites it as 1936. What the book says in a footnote on the subject is ""Sulaiman al-Shaikh - ""The caricature artist Naji al-Ali"" - in the Kuwaiti magazine al-`Arabi, no. 297, August 1983. Naji al-`Ali saw this date and did not raise any objection."" While the book is certainly not academic, it's also worth noting that amongst those thanked by the author is Khalid al-`Ali, the artist's son.On the other hand, on this page Naji al`Ali himself is quoted as saying ""I was born where Christ was born: between Tiberias and Nazareth in the village of al-Shahra in the northern Galilee, and I was expelled from there ten years later in 1948 to `Ain al-Hilwe camp in Lebanon.""However, the same site also bases its short biography of Naji al-`Ali on the book I used, and gives the year 1936 for his birth accordingly.Unless you have a solid source, I think we may have to leave it as unknown.By the way, that site also shows a pretty cool PFLP poster about his assassination, I wonder could we get permission to use it...

" North Korea actually gained approximately 230 km² from China in the 1962 treaty. And here's a 19th century book by Chong Yagyong, titled ""Korea's Northern Border Reigion"" (in a Korean sourcebook compilation translated by Peter Hacksoo Lee): A long time ago, the area north of the Tumen River was the land of the Su-shen people. It has not been under our control since the time of the Three Han. The ''southern slopes of Mount Changbaek, where both the Tumen and Yalu rivers have their headwaters, lay within our territory, but the winding ridges and layers of peaks make the exact location of the border unclear. However, Emperor K'ang-hsi, in the final years of his reign [1662-1722], ordered Area Commander Wu-la (Wu-la ts'ung-kuan) Muk'eteng to delineate the border and erect a stone boundary marker. As a result, the border between those two rivers is clear as well. [emphasis mine]Here's another study of the US-North Korea border in 1962, by the US Dept of State, which makes no mention of North Korea owning the entire mountain.  And another, which says that China actually made concessions to NK on the border in 1962 . The only sources that seem to claim that Korea once owned the entire place are some recent tabloid news articles that protest China conducting activities on its own side of the border, and of course, a few ultranationalist sites, but please, enlighten me if you can provide other reliable sources as well. On another rather amusing note, it does seem my userboxes are being quite effective experiment in showing which users are capable of  judging others by the content their edits, and which prefer to judge a book by it's cover and lash out emotionally.  should be made in a new section on the talk page. No further edits should be made to this section. The result of the debate was no move.  ' Requested moveChonji → Tianchi – The name was unilaterally moved from Tianchi to Chonji without concensus, for POV reasons (cited in move and talk page), such as that it should be Korean (it's on the border between China and Korea). Another reason cited was that the name of the Baekdu Mountain page is Korean as well. However, a Google search shows nearly 30,000 hits for Tianchi, and and less than 1,000 each for Chonji and Cheonji. That's two orders of magnitude in difference. (the preceding was quoted by Yuje)  SurveyAdd ""* Support"" or ""* Oppose"" followed by a brief explanation, then sign your opinion with ~~~~ Support for the most common name. Searches for ""Chonji"" for all the most popular search engines combined give less than a thousand hits. Search on Google scholar shows only 2 uses of the name ""Chonji"" for the lake. The use of Chonji as a clear common name doesn't apply because it's not common.  Support — per Yuje.  Naming conventions gives preference to the more popular name. Oppose per Visviva and my previous comments. Like I said before, we need to use the most common name that is the clearest because ""Tianchi"" is a name for many other places in China.  As shown, Chonji is nowhere near common. Chonji barely shows up any hits, therefore isn't a viable alternative for a clear alternative name.  Oppose Look at my reason below.  Comment:  The proposition seems to be flawed...  Given that Tianchi is now an article on the lake in Urumqi, if this article is moved it would need to go somewhere else; perhaps Tianchi (Changbaishan) or even (heh heh) Tianchi (Paektusan), but then again maybe Tianchi (Jilin)... if we must'' have a straw poll, it would be helpful to know what the full suggested title is.

I'm pretty new to wikipedia, but it seems quite inaccurate to say that the majority of highlanders were Roman Catholic. Aside from the populations of the tiny islands of Barra and South Uist, and a few small areas on the mainland the majority of them would have been Presbyterians or Nonjurant Episcopalians.

"Please consult the article Ball culture, which states ""drag queen, or transgendered"". WP:OR does not cover synthesis by bringing two facts together.  As well, the term ""Femme queen"" does not have an article, so the term is currently of dubious usage as it's a neologism, (which WP policy suggests to avoid using).  You state a source: ""TGMSMNET"", however neither this page, nor the mainpage refer to such a reference.  From the way you talked about it, I linked it to the ""MSTSW"" reference.  In the future, if you could, could you please site resources on this page by using this form? [http://example.com http://example.com] That way it shows up like this http://www.example.com, and one can simply click on the resource, rather than search through the article for the reference itself.  Your data is backed up there as well.  However, we still have issue... how would the CDC consider a post-op MTF living in stealth as anything else but a ""female""... the MTF would obviously not admit to being a transsexual, and in fact engages in no activity any more risky than a ""biological"" female.  (I wait for further evidence that TG/TS is caused by biological factors, and thus the term ""biological male/female"" becomes complicated in even research... no one would ever state that a woman with CAIS is ""biologically"" a male...)  As well, I understand the point of not using WP as a soap box... however in talk pages, I'm still free to assert the better application and appropriate nature of the term ""people having URAP""...

Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/User:Propaniac/su Hi. I've just noticed that you nominated this page in my userspace for deletion at MFD a couple months ago, and it was deleted. TBH, I don't remember what was there, and I was just curious if you remembered the topic (or how you came to notice it in my userspace in the first place). I'm not objecting to the deletion, although I'm kind of surprised that it was worth the trouble of deleting, and to find out that Wikipedia has a policy that allows for deleting of unfinished drafts in userspace (I mean, that seems ironic in light of all the total crap in article-space that I've tried to delete but that's been saved on the theory that maybe someday someone might possibly come along and turn it into something worthwhile). But, again, I'm not objecting or suggesting anything wrong took place, just wondering how it happened. Thanks for any light you can shed.	0|0|0|0|0|0

Yes, you have a point there. I humbly excuse for those edits related to 1 and 3 as they're doubtable. As for 2, I added alleged CIA operative in the article. It is more accurate than 'cult depogrammer' although no such title/profession at all would suffice too. What cults or cult members has he deprogrammed? The word 'cult' is out of context. My edits with regard to 4 are at least better than the previous state. Note, that point 4 is proven by Project Monarch entry and various of its sources on bottom. It is therefore completely bogus to say that CoB and MP are somehow 'the only source'. 2 and 4 in CoB entry were inconsistent with PM entry. The article is now more accurate according to Wikipedia's policies IMO. Have a look and a nice day or 2.	0|0|0|0|0|0

"Note from the subject book::Śrīla Prabhupāda-līlāmṛta:«And he did not have to flatter anyone, support anyone, or manage anyone's life. His mind and intelligence were free and dwelt constantly on his service to his spiritual master. He saw his present circumstances as a preparation for a greater task before him. Despite his advanced age, he felt that he had barely begun his work. Yet he felt confident. He had his vision of a world association of devotees. It was not an idle dream, although he was not certain how it would all come about. But he knew his duty. For the present he would go on describing his vision, the vision of his predecessor spiritual masters, in articles and books. But as soon as possible he should go to the West. Westerners, he had concluded, were not satisfied with a materially comfortable life devoid of spiritual understanding; more than his fellow Indians, they would be open to the message of the Absolute Truth. He knew he should go. And he would go-if Kṛṣṇa desired.Abhay lived frugally in Vṛndāvana, keeping exact account of every expenditure and every receipt. He carefully kept a ledger, just as if he were running a substantial business, even though his purchases were only a little milk, a few vegetables, charcoal for cooking, bus rides, and his major expenditure, postage.-Abhay composed a Bengali poem, ""Vṛndāvana-bhajana."" Its opening stanzas were especially self-reflective and personal.I am sitting alone in Vṛndāvana-dhāma.In this mood I am getting many realizations.I have my wife, sons, daughters, grandsons, everything,But I have no money, so they are a fruitless glory.Kṛṣṇa has shown me the naked form of material nature;By His strength it has all become tasteless to me today.Yasyāham anugṛhṇāmi hariṣye tad-dhanaṁ śanaiḥ:""I gradually take away all the wealth of those upon whom I am merciful."" How was I able to understand this mercy of the all-merciful?»Śrīla Prabhupāda is here in the ADVANCED AGE of 61– his supporters, friends and family left him broke.Śrīla Prabhupāda-līlāmṛta another reference:«Prabhupāda's most ambitious literary undertaking, the completion of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, was to be no less than sixty volumes. He had begun in India in 1959, and all along he had been aware that he was attempting a gigantic task at an advanced age. Now Kṛṣṇa was giving him opportunities both for writing Vedic literatures and for travelling, and he was working at an amazing pace.»Prabhupāda is here in ADVANCED AGE of 63 starting to write his Bhaktivedanta Purports – I guess in India it was an advanced age, but not in Florida."	0|0|0|0|0|0

" 2010 (UTC)I don't think the definition from Webbs really works given the change that has happened since it was first written (1917) . The idea that professionals ""supply disinterested counsel and service to others, for a direct and definite compensation, wholly apart from expectation of other business gain"" is a bit naive, particularly in the I think a more realistic and up to date defintion is required.For instance, in the light of Holocaust, in which many German professionals acted as instruments of a disfunctional state, which would tend to indicate that ""service for others"" may not be have the intention, but was taken to a tragic extreme. Likewise the recent financial crisis would tend to indicate that profession of banker (if it is a profession) has shown to conducted wholly for business gain (i.e. higher profit, larger bonuses), whilst other professions have shown themselves to be very interested in business gain, often to the detriment to the business (e.g. accountants in the Enron scandal).

" Disruptive Activity  Please stop your disruptive editing. If you continue to vandalize Wikipedia, as you did at Paracetamol, you may be blocked from editing.    🍌 (email) Yeah, so I add two interesting and important new, relevant references to an article which indicates potential harm to pregnant women on the Paracetamol page. These are removed because you guys don't like primary sources? This is ridiculous and frankly an extreme case of what is wrong with Wikipedia. My wife is pregnant. I for sure want to know about potential harm of this drug. I would think as a medical professional that you would be more inspired by the ""first do no harm"" idea. The fact that you Wikipedia jerks are so focused on having only sources from a narrow range of whatever it takes for a given article is so frustrating. I've continued to run into this kind of thing. You would think that academic journals have taken over Wikipedia. The idea that I have actually improved the article with my additions, and that others can improve it further, has completely escaped much of the Wikipedia culture these days. Wikipedia has simply forgotten the idea that this is collaboratively edited, rather than having a coterie of people who simply reject all edits if they do not thread the eye of the needle through the dozens of acronym style guides. You guys are disgusting, really. You are standing on the shoulders of millions of edits and now you reject the very thing that got you to where you are, namely lots of collaboratively edited small improvements. Now any change has to go through hurdles that would never have created Wikipedia in the first place. The fact that you have excluded something that is evidence of significant danger to pregnant women based on this culture of exclusiveness should trouble you deeply.    I'm sorry that I've upset you, but the fact is we get hundreds upon hundreds of poor quality changes every day. That is why we've written WP:MEDRS which I pointed to when I reverted you. There is also an excellent essay on why we adhere so strongly to it at WP:WHYMEDRS. The fact is that many primary studies are either performed on mice or on very small populations so that their results can't be transferred into clinical practise. MEDRS is no catch all, but it helps us and makes patrolling many articles and removing citations from the daily mail easier. I would also like to point out that we are working on getting these types of warnings into our articles automatically, for example by having FDA warnings automatically added.I understand it may feel as if you're being reverted by a faceless mass, but I assure you if you had simply taken up the discussion it would have been far more likely to be productive.   🍌 (email)  This isn't about my feelings, it is about your behavior. You revert me with no reason, then start quoting this bureaucratic nonsense, then threaten me with banning due to my disruptive editing. This is why Wikipedia is dying, cannibalizing its editors and edits in a Kafkaesque farce. Congratulations, I'm sure your no-doubt proper and uplifting ZYZZYXRD will be cited upon its demise.

":::::You resorting to dishonesty is disgusting and vile Binksternet.For starters, dating back to the original discussion back in December 2009, while the user Optigan liked FinancialNorth1, he preferred a cropped version of the fourth photo, to which no including PaulH or you for that matter said anything as clearly noted in the discussion. As i'm saying again for the umpteenth time and as the record showed, no decision was made and the discussion ended. Paulh, or you did not say anything. If he wanted the photo then, why didn't he continue to press his case then and convince a consensus then? I would've left it at that then, but instead he and other editors remained silent. I didn't restart the discussion because I assumed that the editors simply lost interest, or didn't have the time.Furthermore, I did not ""slip in"" as you disgustingly, dishonestly, facetiously say. I only added that photo because I noticed for the time being that no one had made a decision since the original discussion back in January. Again, no one did anything for months. You and Paulh cannot claim you didn't see the change, because you made several other edits throughout the article for months.Again, Paul did not form a consensus prior to the change, or continue the discussion where it had left off. Once again, he instead changed the photo, got a ""consensus"" from Binksternet. The IP editor liked the photo, but, quoting the editor again:""Any of the photos in that section (""FinancialNorth.jpg""; ""Montgomerystreetsf.jpg""; ""Federal Reserve Band (San Francisco).jpg"") except #2 (SanFranciscoEmbarcadero.jpg) would be fine as a replacement, and even the cropped version of #2 is better than the one currently there now. Thoughts?64.81.57.93 (talk)""""I'm going to replace it with ""FinancialNorth.jpg"" and see what happens.""The crux of it was that Paulh made the change before even Binksternet approved it, or I or other editors could respond.Binksternet's abusive little crusade against me shows my point that he and Paul have no interest in perusing collaborative editing efforts. Despite my reverts, I at least agreed to having a discussion and a ""photo choosing contest"" as it were. Paulh did not and Binksternet is now acting as some kind of enforcing.

"(Ivo Banac)...A bit of nonteleological historyOne of the great problems is that our understanding of the common and individual histories of the South Slavs and the other peoples of southeastern Europe has not significantly benefited from critical historiography. This is because nationalist historiographies regularly have explained modern developments as an aspect of unilinear design. We have been taught to see connections that may be of our own making. For example, if we look at a current political map of the area and compare it to that from the era of settlements we will see that the present political divisions do not correspond to those from the early medieval period. Croatia is mainly a coastal area from the Rasa River in Istria to the Cetina River, a little bit to the east of the city of Split. Down the coast from the original Croatia, we have a row of unfamiliar Slavic territories that Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus, the tenth-century Byzantine emperor-historian, called Pagania (literally, land of the pagans), Zachlumia (most of present-day eastern Herzegovina, with the Croatian peninsula of Peljesac), Terbounia (the Trebinje area of eastern Herzegovina, with Dubrovnik and its eastern coastal environs), and Dioclea (the southern portions of contemporary Montenegro with the Bay of Kotor and the northwesternmost portions of present-day Albania around Lake Skadar/Shkoder). Serbia is located in the hinterland of Zachlumia, Terbounia, and Dioclea, its center around Ras, near today's Novi Pazar, in the Sandzak. Bosnia was apparently within this territory, but represented a negligible area around the source of the Bosna River, where we now find Sarajevo and its environs. And Dalmatia? In the tenth-century this was a necklace of Byzantine-ruled Roman coastal cities and island territories, from Krk in the north to Ulcinj in the south.Moreover, modern territoriality required a tradition that was itself a product of modernity. Thus, unrelated traditions were merged to produce an idea of ethnic-as opposed to cultural-continuity. The Croat historical tradition goes back to the Chronicle of the Priest of Dioclea (a twelfth-century text from Bar in contemporary Montenegro) and its various translations (for example, Marko Marulic, 1510), which were in turn incorporated into the Early Modern ""Slavic"" and ""Dalmatian"" histories of Mavro Orbin (1601) and Ivan Lucic (Ioannes Lucius, 1666). These works then became material for the Croatianizing work of Pavao Ritter Vitezovic (Croatia rediviva, 1700), who was the most important influence on the revivalist generation of Ljudevit Gaj (1809-1872) and that of postrevival integral nationalists like Ante Starcevic (1823-1896). Curiously, the same histories (Orbin's) were Serbianized through the translations of Sava Vladislavic (1722), which then influenced the pioneering Serbian histories of Jovan Rajic (1794), and were Bulgarianized in the history of Paisij Hilandarski (1762). The Bosnian historical tradition was somewhat more self-contained. It combined the Franciscan memory of medieval Bosnian statehood with the experiences of Muslim ayan (notable) selfrule to argue for a uninational Bosnia (for example, Antun Knezevic, whose book was published between 1884 and 1887).Clearly, something has happened in the span of ten centuries. Pagania, Zachlumia, and Terbounia have disappeared. The center of Croatia has migrated from the Adriatic to the north, into medieval Slavonia (literally, Slavic land), with Zagreb at its head. This happened in stages. During the High Middle Ages, the heart of Croatia was on the Una River, now in northwestern Bosnia. This territory (Turkish Croatia) was lost to the Ottomans in the sixteenth century and became a part of Bosnia. During the Habsburg reconquest and the concomitant Venetian operations in the seventeenth century, the framework of modern Croatia emerged in two extended shanks-one, to the north, to modern Slavonia; the other, in the south, in modern Dalmatia. At the same time, the Zagreb area, which was only dubiously Croatian in the early Middle Ages, became the heart of modern Croatia.The story of Serbia is not much different. Serbia first migrated to the coast and assimilated Dioclea. Then it moved to the Ibar-Morava valleys; then toward the valleys of Struma and Vardar in Macedonia. It reached the Danube only as an Ottoman vassal in the fifteenth century. And its modern capital, Belgrade, became truly Serbian only in the course of Karadjordje's uprising in 1806. Bosnia, too, expanded under Ban (or prorex) Kulin (r. 1180-1204) into the Donji Kraji (literally, Lower Lands) around the Vrbas River and the Soli (literally, Salt Lands; for centuries, Ottoman, then modern Tuzla) and Usora, in its present northeastern corner. Later on, at the height of its power in fourteenth century, Bosnia expanded into Hum (Herzegovina) and the Drina River valley. The westernmost regions were inc	0|0|0|0|0|0

Editor Review Hey, thanks for your review of me at ER.  I was previously aware of the naming conventions debate.  It is a tough topic, obviously.  I support a fairly common sense approach to the subject.  If it deals with politics, name it by political entity, if it deals with geography, name it by place, etc.  I'll stop by the Chinese naming conventions page later today and catch up on the recent discussion.I didn't know previously about your project to clean up China-related categories.  Cleaning and reorganizing categories is one of my favorite Gnome-like tasks to do on WP.  What specific changes did you have in mind?I really should help out more at FAC.  Sometimes I just don't want to read all the way through an article.  Lazy, I know.  I'll look into conflict mediation too.As for my translation of the Chinese Redology page, I kind of got frustrated because my Chinese ability is not quite good enough to do a good translation.  English is my native language, I'm only a third-year student of Chinese.  Someone else seems to have translated some of the material and put it on our Redology page.  Thanks again for the review, hope to work with you soon.	0|0|0|0|0|0

"YOUR SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS AND ADDICTIONThis is the most ""contructive"" thing that can ever be contributed as it relates to you and your involvement here: Please stop and think about the depth of your sickness, sitting there, with your face glued to your computer screen, uncompensated day after day, week after week, for YEARS, tinkering with the biographies of people you don't even know, who actually are out living real lives while you are imprisoned by your addiction.  You have literally wasted years of your life with this lonely, self-destructive addiction and illness, which has been at the expense of living your own life.  The depth of your mental illness must make it difficult for you to see the extraordinary insanity of your actions and how your addiction has stripped you of the life that was given you.  I know a few others have evaluated what you do here and laugh at you and your sickness.  It's something of an inside joke, and I guess few share it with you because they consider you hopeless.  That's not right either, and I'd ask them to please stop that and try to help you.  Don't laugh at this person behind their back and then just communicate with them on routine matters.  That lacks all caring for a person who has an obvious and very serious illness. Something is very wrong with him/her, and while it may not be for us to diagnose the exact problem, we should pause to help with advice.  Please share with him/her what we all know.  It's only humane to do so. I will do so now too:Jerzy (or whatever your name isconsciously concealed, I'm sure, to keep your illness as private as possible), please consider some uncomfortable facts:  Years of your life have now been totally consumed and absolutely wasted by your deep, deep sickness and obvious addiction.  Please don't make excuses for yourself.  You cannot go on like this any longer.  You need to stop, and you need to stop today.  Reject this advice, and I worry that your sickness will probably only deepen and your addiction will waste whatever is left of your life.  Please stop.  It's over.  Enough.  Move on.  I do wish you the best and hope you will take this friendly advice seriously.  It will be the first and last time I share it, and I hope you know that I share it only with your best interests in mind.  It's sad what has happened to you, but I wish you good luck and hope this advice is helpful.  But please take itand do so today.  You cannot go on like this."	0|0|0|0|0|0

"Skywriter: I have tried to be civil with you.  I would ask that you return the favor.  Remember, I didn't even write the old lede; I picked that as merely being most likely to be non-controversial.  Also note that on every single edit page, there's a big statement saying ""If you don't want your writing to be edited mercilessly or redistributed for profit by others, do not submit it.""  Part of the ""edited mercilessly"" part is that people will criticize your writing.  It's nothing personal.""If you see no evidence that Kinzer's book brought about a massive reassessment of the 1953 coup in Iran, then you did not read the book or the reviews.""Amazon reviews are worthless for determining how important a book is, merely how good one is.  But whatever, you didn't include a direct mention in the most recent version, so let's just drop this.  (And for about the billionth time, since you mention in my edit summary that I'm ""criticizing"" Kinzer....  I'm doing no such thing.  I'm sure the book is very good, judging from the review given by the CIA history fellow.  But ""very good"" is not the same as ""an element of crowning importance in the coup itself.""  People knew after 1979 that something had gone horribly wrong, so this was not a new revelation.""Aggression aside, SnowFire, the underlying flaw in your windy analysis is the absence of credible sourcing"" You said earlier that ""Your other comments are too general to address. If you would like to suggest specific changes to the wording, feel free to bring it here for comment.""  I decided to expand on the many problems with the lede, and now it's a ""windy"" analysis.  Got it.  But aside from sniping, you still fail to understand that my biggest problems with your version of the lede have nothing to do with sourcing.  It has to do with what information is appropriate for the lede.  There are a million and one possible, sourced facts that can be mentioned in the lede; we have to pick which ones.  I have no doubt that your text was sourced; it doesn't mean it's automatically appropriate for the lede.Yes, and it shows just how careful were your mad rush of reverts last night. Fast and loose with facts,Let me say it again: Are you denying that Cold War paranoia had anything to do with the coup?  Do you realize what references are for?  It's to confirm facts.  This fact is obvious and supported by every source, including your own, so it doesn't particularly matter what it was referenced to.  If you want to source it better have a blast, but this is not even close to ""fast and loose with the facts.""Albright's ""apology""You've got a point that the linked NYTimes article doesn't call it apology.  Remember, I didn't write the old lede!  Fair enough if we want to remove that due to being murkier than we'd like.The CIA does cite vague fear of the Soviet Union in its most recent justification for the coup. However, the CIA's accounting, published in 2007, three years after the publication of Kinzer's path-breaking book (2003), must be weighed against the CIA's destruction of most of its documents related to this coupWait, the CIA destroyed the documents, so therefore the Soviet Union had nothing to do with it?  That logic doesn't flow.  More to the point, the idea that Cold War machinations were behind the US involvement is in literally every source.  I haven't read All the Shah's Men, but from your linked book review (the one by a notable person, not from Amazon reviewers), it seems to be in that, too!  I quote..Eisenhower and his secretary of state, John Foster Dulles, were dedicated to rolling back communism and defending democratic governments threatened by Moscow's machinations.Kinzer depicts him as beguiled by a moralistic John Foster and a cynical Allen.By ignoring the anticommunist basis of US policy, he wrenched the dispute with the AIOC out of its Cold War context and saw it only from his parochial nationalist viewpoint. Lastly, Mossadeq's naïvete about communist tactics led him to ignore the Tudeh Party's efforts to penetrate and control Iranian institutions. He seemed almost blithely unaware that pro-Soviet communists had taken advantage of democratic systems to seize power in parts of Eastern Europe. By not reining in Iran's communists, he fell on Washington's enemies list. https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol48no2/article10.html....yeah.  As a reminder this is from a review of your favored source.  (Also note that Dulles is described as ""moralistic,"" i.e. interested in stopping the communists, not greedy / interested in oil.

I have simply copied in the three articles that join together to indicate a cause for eczma/ psoriosis. These are factual and are in the wikipedia. As follows. This is very acurate information. This is true information and this parasite ( ascaris)is a cause of both eczma and or psoriosis.All I have done is join the dots wikipedia has the answers many sufferers are looking for. Connecting the dots isn't allowed, I'm afraid. It's called synthesis and is considered a form of original research, which is against our policies here. If ascaris is acknowledged to be the cause of psoriasis, it would be best to source this fact from an article in a medical journal or perhaps a medical textbook. -	0|0|0|0|0|0
":Thanks very much for the Restored Toungoo map. Borders: It's close enough but I wish it's possible to use increasingly lighter shades. E.g., You've followed the present-day border, more or less, for the Chinese border, which I suppose is a reasonable representation of the ""line of control"".

Anaukpetlun and Thalun controlled some of Koshanpye (1622-1626 campaigns) on top of present-day Shan State and east of Bhamo (though not as extensive or deeper into Yunnan as did Bayinnaung); likewise, all the sawbwas in modern Kachin State and sawbwas in northern Shan State also paid dual tribute.

If you're an Arab, or pro-Arab, you would indeed use ""Palestine"", if you're an Israeli or pro-Israeli, you would use ""Eretẓ Yisra'el"" (the land of Israel). Both are anachronisms, while ""Eretz Yisra'el"" pre-dates ""Palestine"". True, it was used for years by Western authors, but is it accurate? no. should it be accepted, when it's obviously a historical mistake? no.

" Germany -  four entries You did not respond to my argument at all - please read it more carefully:The IOC cannot be seen as the single authoritative source on this article, as the IOC itself does not publish all-time tables, and publishes only unofficial tables per single Games. Therefore this article is in violation with WP:No original research! The official source for the German National Olympic Committee (DOSB) does list the Olympic Medals for Germany from 1896 to 2012 → .There were no official country codes before 1976: Only in 1976 did the IOC start to assign standardized codes. Before that time, the local Organizing Committees of each Olympic Games had chosen codes, often in the local language, resulting in a multitude of codes.At the Games of 1956, 1960, and 1964 the German team was simply known as ""Germany"" and the usual country code of (GER) was used. Yet, the IOC code EUA is currently applied in hindsight in the IOC medal database, without further explanation given. Yugoslavia does not exist anymore as a country - the FRG does. The (FRG) Federal Republic of Germany did not cease to exist. It was a simple code change, same country, same NOC. NO alternate NOCs: EUA, FRG and GER have always had the same German National Olympic Committee (NOC) recognized in 1895, same NOC President (Willi Daume, 1960–1993), same Olympic Committee located in Frankfurt - only the codes have changed. Germany is officially still called (FRG), the Federal Republic of Germany - it's the same country, with the same NOC since the first modern Games held in 1896 - only the GDR had a separate NOC, because it was a separate country (although not recognized by Germany). ""West Germany"" did never exist, and is nothing more than the common English name used for the Federal Republic of Germany or FRG. The ""enlarged"" Federal Republic of Germany (known simply as ""Germany"") is thus the continuation of the pre-1990 Federal Republic of Germany - the very same country, with the same National Olympic Committee since 1895.

You can't ban anyone so please avoid talking about bans, since there isn't any consensus. You are just trying to impose your will regardless of the facts other people are providing to back their statements, without backing YOUR statements yourself. This map made by Renato Biasutti is more than enough. It clearly shows that, for instance, in Veneto % of blond people is from three to seven times higher than in Calabria, and in Tuscany is at least three times higher than in Sardinia. This is definitely relevant. Now of course you will say this map is:1) old (but you won't provide a newer one)2) not credible (but you won't provide a more credible map)3) same difference as other countries (but you won't provide a single source proving that)Etc.

" Obviously there is some anti-Americanism in Canada. This means nothing, necessarily, with regards to the structure of this article. I was referring to the specific idea that Canadian students fear their sovereignty will be overwhelmed, or that Canadians consider themselves cultural correctives to Americans. And I asked for another side of the story, and questioned how big of a deal this was to put in the introduction. Your response here is confusing. As far as ""citing my sources"", I am questioning your views and whether they belong in the article, not making additions to the article. Several of your quotes are very weak examples... many countries could claim anti-Americanism on the basis of involvement in the Middle-East... that doesn't mean it's a relevant enough addition to put into the INTRODUCTION of an article on one of the most trafficked websites in the world, that is meant to specifically talk about the MAJOR issues between two specific countries. As far as your sources go, you did not comment on the obscurity of them. You have still not properly defended James Tagg (yes, that was me who removed that a year ago). I don't see why you get to just dub a source ""reliable"", when I thoroughly explained why I determined it ""unreliable"" (or, rather, inappropriate to add). I read that source, left you detailed comments, and you said something like ""Don't POV push"" and reverted my edits. You are not making an argument here. (re: Culture Clash in Archive 2)Again, there are two sides to every story. Please try to tell both if you are going to edit this article. Many Canadians would laugh at the idea that the USA causes a ""profound fear"" that their sovereignty will be overwhelmed (and why do students' opinions have so much weight, by the way?). But there likely won't be many sources to support this, because the initial premise that it even might be the case is so rare that such sources wouldn't exist for a counter argument. Nevertheless, I'll take a look...One last time... this is about obscurity clouding neutrality, and onesideness breaching neutrality. I am not trying to say that what you're saying is not true at all. I'm sure it is true the the extent that it is. But how much is that? The points in question fall so far below the relevance required to be in the introduction to an article, that they should be immediately moved."	0|0|0|0|0|0

In the Quran, Muhammad is referred to as the ""Seal of the Prophets"" or the ""last Prophet"".Followers of Mani (founder of the Persian faith Manichaeism) believe that these titles (the Seal of the Prophets and the Last Prophet) are attributed to Mani who, his followers claim, came before Muhammad.I've bolded the statements that makes it NPOV.

First, I just realized via your question that I could answer here. (Assuming it saves.)Yes, I finally get that my attacks were totally inappropriate and unneccessary? I confess I did not at first, even this morning.I realize I made inappropriate attacks after looking at his contributions and assuming some highly speculative personal motivation and then asking him about it in an offensive way. I would not be at all surprised if others have made negative assumptions about me based on looking at my contributions history and attacked me, so the user does have my sincere sympathies and apologies.What to do differently when groups go after me? Write a better Wikiquette name several people? Go to WP:ANI naming several people? Do User:RfCs naming several people? That is where I admit I need further advice. Since a 7.5 year old off wiki email is often the focus of harassment, and so far the advice is not to go into detail about it, I don't know how to defend the recurrent references to it. Let me say again, it was a stupid, overly generalized and exaggerated response, but certainly not written with some evil bigoted intent. I feel that a lengthy correction of it complete with refs about then existing specific incidents/issues/etc, or stating in detail my current views, would be inappropriate, even on my user page and doubtless lead to more accusations by people who have a different POV.

But when I saw that you had manually edited the list templates, I thought perhaps you had disabled the Bot until it was working properly.Basically you're telling me the syntax that is commonly used throughout Wikipedia, vertical piping, is not valid within the RFC templates?

"Minor wording issue about steamboatsI'm doing some bits of minor copyediting and am stuck on this sentence, from the Navigation section: The use of steamboats along the river, beginning in 1850... There is a footnote, to this timeline page, which phrases it ""1850: Steamboats Columbia and Lot Whitcomb begin regular service on the Columbia River."" The thing is there were steamboats in regular service on the river before 1850, at least to Fort Vancouver. The first was the Beaver (steamship), which arrived at Ft Vancouver in 1836. I thought about rewording the sentence The regular use of steamboats along the river..., but that isn't quite right either because the Beaver was in ""regular use"", even if its operations were not limited to the river. Anyway, I can't come up with a way to reword this bit, especially given the existence of the footnote, which does not mention the Beaver. So I'm just mentioning it here.

" The Band's legacy, Beggar's Banquet, etc. An anonymous user is repeatedly misreading The Guardian source and insisting on adding a dubious tag to it.  Here's the direct quote:The spark for Fairport taking this watershed turn was the Band's 1968 album Music from Big Pink, the record that - along with Bob Dylan and the Band's Basement Tapes bootleg - brought about a widespread musical volte-face, in which what remained of psychedelia was replaced by a new rootsiness. Among the rock aristocracy, its influence was evident in the Beatles' ill-fated back-to-basics project Let It Be, the Rolling Stones' purple patch that began with Beggars Banquet, and Eric Clapton's decision to call time on Cream.The anonymous user takes issue with this statement, claiming that Music from Big Pink could not have influenced Beggar's Banquet because of chronology, i.e., that the Stones were almost done recording the album when Big Pink came out.  But, read the statement: it does not say that it influenced the recording of Banquet, but the ""purple patch that began with...,"" etc.  This seems clear to me.

In just the same way that a retraction will be due from Jimbo if he somehow comes up with a proposal that would not have ""100% prevented"" the Ted Kennedy incident.I hope that you might also realise that if in your words the case here is ""thankfully relatively rare"", why many people would then think that applying a blanket measure such as Flagged Revisions is not very appropriate at all. I contrast it as the British Government contending every citizen must be forced to carry an identity card, on the presumption that is the best way you can catch terrorists, which happen to also be ""thankfully relatively rare"".

(and any interested observers, please, stop before you say it, these valid concerns with what FR is/could be cannot all just be washed away by referring to the quite irrelevant 'advantage' of FR of opening up the tiny minority of protected articles).And to further address the specific example you give, maybe you can expand on why anybody would be likely to believe that one sentence claim, when it was added to the article along with another 15 sentences, which at best hint at the whole thing being a hoax, and at worst, screams delete me now for being total WP:BOLLOCKS. We can also discuss how an editor in between the vandalism and your removal 'fixes the article for typos'  without noticing that it is 90% complete bollocks? Even when one of the typos is a few words away from the molesting red flag. A systemic failure perhaps?And finally, as an admin, perhaps you can tell me why the IP user is not now blocked, irrespective of how long ago the edit occurred. Incidentally, the now famous bad account on Ted Kennedy was also not blocked immmediately after his first edit was a BLP violation on an unrelated article. Another systemic failure?I'm all for criticla analysis of cases 'FR would have prevented', because they frequently pose more questions than they answer, about the whole model of Wikipedia, never mind how we efficiently and intelligently prevent BLP violations.

Thanks for the response.  I understand how to use AWB, and I've seen many useful edits with it, as you describe.  But I don't understand  why line breaks after section headers, specifically, need to be undone.  Is it something built into AWB that you are agreeing to because it prompts you, or is it something you added for a particular reason?  The reason I'm curious is because I see people, such as myself, add a line after the section header in the edit window all the time and it seems inefficient if there is a guideline in the MOS or somewhere saying otherwise.

Maybe Kane planted information stating that it was from Africa; or maybe it really WAS from Africa, and Kane's attempts to drum up support in the USSR were unsuccessful.

So you want me to lie and say Le Grand, did nothing wrong?  I think you should look through more of his AFD comments. Many times, he lists the Don't Destroy essay, with Wikipedia policies. Lumping those together with no clarification on what is what, isn't the correct thing to do. I'm sure many people do click the essay and see it's opinion, but there is others that just assume it's policy due to it being listed with a bunch of other policies. I'm not an expert on the unblock policy, but I don't think this is part of it.

reverting to last known edit by me. The article was vandalized a few days ago and is now being returned to its original state. Any users wishing to dispute the information should do so here. If sysops examine the network log files, they will discover that the vast majority of referers come from 9/11 Truth sites, and the vast majority of exit links go to 9/11 Truth sites. Therefore, removing that information was damaging wikipedia's reputation. Visitors are depending on wikipedia to cover the work that Jones is currently involved in, which of course includes everything relating to 9/11 that was on that page.Using the CT term to describe 9/11 theories is ad hominem and also not NPOV, and therefore not civil. Anyone endorsing that type of thinking is not NPOV and ask them to not edit the 9/11 pages.As the Zogby poll shows, 42% of America believes the government is covering up 9/11 and 45% want a new investigation including government officials possibly being involved.For now on, any vandalism or ad hominem remarks will be dealt with via official complaints using Wikipedia protocol.Also, even though my ad hominem remarks were direct retaliation, I do apologize for them. Anyone using these types of remarks should not be editing these pages. I expect anyone and everyone to be civil.	0|0|0|0|0|0

As far as presenting sources are concerned, the book The life and exploits of Alexander the Great  sites much more sources in detail than source, which I think refers to some sources already referred by others. As such it is as credible as its own sources and not whether the Author is researcher of repute and printed by reputed publisher. Its credibility therefore lies in sources which are presented sparsely in the book perhaps, perhaps not. As far as the Author is concerned, in my understanding, he himself suggested that the story of Alexander that originated from Egypt should be considered more authentic than others ( reasons given as ..it is hardly likely that their writers and scribes would hasten to record his history, whereby they would also incidentally describe their own national defeat; to these countries, then, we must not look for the original Alexander story. Similarly, we must not look to the states of Greece for it, because at the death of Alexander the memory of their subjugation and the victorious deeds which he wrought for the glory of Macedon would be too fresh in the minds of their peoples. One country only could be the birthplace of the Alexander story, and that country was Egypt..). I am not sure if the general discussion is driven by this very idea i.e. keeping the Alexander story from Egypt as authentic (which the scholarship of the author has indeed explained so well along with origin of other sources, especially ones from Greece that perhaps dominate current understanding). This according to me, forms one of the essence of the Alexander story, and I hope someone clarifies which story is the Egypt story in the said book which I myself is unsure for I don't have that experience and skill to tell out the exact parts off Egypt origins. At the most I can only hope that someone will research into the Alexander story from Egypt, and not his fanboy fantasies from Greece, to put forth a credible understanding if not already done. Then perhaps someone can put up that as reliable secondary source on the internet and can be referred to here.	0|0|0|0|0|0

"@Shmayo I already know the map from John Speed, but this far away from being an evidence that the Suryoye/Suraye called themselves Assyrians or considered the ancient Assyrians as their ancestors. The ""Deutschen"" don't call themselves Germans (Germanen) or Alemanes (Alemannen) in their native tongue and it's not the first time that the word Suryoye/Suraye was mistranslated into ""Assyrian"" by outsiders:missionaries and colonists. Do you have quotes or chronicles from Nestorian Christians BEFORE the 19th century and in their OWN words, which shows an ethnic Assyrian continuity? The Syriac-Orthodox Church has quotes and chronicles which goes hundreds of years back, where they equate Suryoyo with Oromoyo in their OWN words. Interestingly, the Arameans from Maalula who are either Christian Melkites or Muslims call their Aramaic language/dialect also ""Siryon"" or ""Loghtha Siryanoytha(Aramoytha)"", which is a result of Greek-Christian influence on the Arameans. The word Suryoyo, which literally simply means Syrian in English is rather a religious term similar to Maronites, Catholics or Melkites. Nevertheless words can change their meanings in course of history. Even if the word Suryoyo derives from Assyrian ot doesn't change the fact that the Arameans where also known by this name.

This article seems to me about right in its focus on what English-speakers normally mean by ""banana"", namely the food, where it comes from, what it is, how it's grown, etc. It would be possible to move some the taxonomy material to Musa (genus) perhaps, with some cross-referencing, so that the article concentrates more on the food and agricultural aspects of the topic, but this would be a marginal change.

"== Unblock requests =={{unblock reviewed|1=Sorry for my blurb here, I went in detail elsewhere. If an admins reviews the complete history of astrotheology, they will notice that I've been patient while I had to deal with other editors extreme language at me. That creates a very stressful situation. Please see here for outside opinion. I did not use the same kind of language against Hrafn, and he had no right to immediately jump on my case while I added content to the article. I was the only active contributor to that astrotheology that was adding content to it, even before the AfD process. I noticed it was a stub and started to add content. How am I being disruptive to other there, when there was no other editors that wanted to contribute? I even listed 30 potential sources on the talk page that had mentions of astrotheology. Others could have reviewed them and find if they had anything worthwhile if they actually wanted to be ""an editor of astrotheology"" and *add content*. Hrafn, on the talk page, even labeled me as an atheist and other categorized pov pusher. It is obvious he was against something, but that something wasn't me like he thought, and he couldn't believe otherwise  or choose not to. Somehow this went from something that was just a little beyond a content dispute because of the harassment I got from Hrafn, to where Durova stepped in and it went directly to ArbCom. She did ask about PastorDavid, but I looked and I left evidence on AN/I of why I didn't accept his offer  that is not a refusal to dispute resolution, that is seeing that the one who offered mentor made a questionable vote on an AfD. I felt another mentor/mediator, would be best. (Personal attack/comment redacted by   ) If you look however, I did ask on the talk page for astrotheology to Hrafn about RS/N over the Physico-Theology book... he didn't answer at all to that question, but he went on to despise me instead with more ""egregious misintrepretations."" As for the previous dispute resolution attempts before that Durova noted, those weren't because of disruptive editing. I never caused anybody to leave wikipedia. If you seriously think I did, it would be more appreciate if you mentioned that evidence to support it than just baselessly blame me. The previous mediation was recommended by a mentor, (Comments redacted by   ) I hate the show the mistakes she made also, we aren't all-knowing saints of wikipedia policy from day one. Why did she even bring it old beginnings back up? The computer science related one was dealt with differently since it was called unfair why I got blocked before. After unblock, the consensus continued , and it still sustains today. If I truly was trying to disrupt like Durova claims, don't you think a intentional disrupter would stalk her and revert her edits and such all along. (Comment redacted by   ) It would be a test to see if she requests unblock, but since she made it clear on my talk page she never want to see me again, I really doubted her olive branch. I deleted a section here on my talk page of her ""vanish"" forever bit. I simply did not reply to her, (Comment redacted by   ) You can argue all you want that I changed the section title, which policy does allow for neutral view, (Comments redacted by   ) When ArbCom said this is obvious, I truly don't think he meant to block me... the obvious answer is let the community help  offer to help mediate. I saw absolutely no other offer to help mediate besides PastorDavid's. However, I sent an e-mail to ask her ""why... why.. why..""... but now she is calling it ""obscene,"" and offers to show it to any admin. If you read it(Comment redacted by   ) Like I said on AN/I...|decline=reason — Not only has the user not apologized for obvious bad behavior, but has offered further attacks and emails with multiple four letter words (the G-D word primarily) to his opponents. I see no reason to unblock. The consensus of the couple arbitrators who looked at this was that this was something the community should handle, and the community has handled.   23:39, 6 June 2008 (	0|0|0|0|0|0

I have seen your edits on Milton's page, you seem to be under the impression he is a ""creationist"" if you bothered to read his books you would see is is actually a neo-lamarckist, Milton has been misrepresented.Here is what Spanner says about Milton:""He writes well, forcefully and with conviction""""""This book is well produced"" Did you forget those bits?On a side note - Who is David Spanner? Hes a fundamentalist Christian, who trained as mainly a physicist, he was not an expert on biology, he mainly wrote about thermodynamics and religion, of course he would of disagreed with some of Milton's views becuase Milton is non-religious: Here is Douglas Spanner Douglas Spanner  "	0|0|0|0|0|0

I did not know that Erbacan was also in the Turkish government in 1974... In any case, every turkish politician is within the kemalistic ideology... since noone criticising or rejecting or judging this ideology, but they all accept it. Taksim can as well have this link. The Megali Idea was not that simple as establishing a Greek state that covers all the Greeks, as u said... The Greeks of Pontus, Southern Italy, former southern Serbia (modern FYROM), Eastern Rumelia, Alexandria, Cyprus, where excluded. Yes, Megali Idea shares similarities with Enosis, that's why the link is present in that article. but adding Megali Idea and excluding Kemalistic Ideology from Taksim, seems, at least weird, cause Kemalism is much more relevant with Taksim than Megali Idea could ever be.

" rename aussie film list index Sorry, I'm on the fence with that one ""Index and resources"" kind of longwinded to me, difficult to get to easily (without redirection). But I completely agree with you as to what the page is, it's partly disambiguation and not useful for much else except for the links... Maybe also, (although controversial as to what to list) the page could summarise the influential films for that country in a concise list of around top 10-30 films of notability or really made an impact on culture?? But then I guess that's what the cinema of Australia article is for... yeah I'm not sure about that particular title, but I think it might be better to steer it into something... Maybe it should just be a disambiguation page and the links and resources might be better suited on the Cinema of Australia page?? "	0|0|0|0|0|0

" Template:Infobox Network Hi. I've restored your version of the code for the template header, so that it appears within the infoboxas is standardrather than above it. This, and adding a couple optional info lines, has brought me to the limits of my coding ability. Request: Is it possible to further modify the code, so an editor has the option of employing the infobox without using a header at all? (See, for example, the use of Infobox Biography in Henry Cowell.) When I attempt this with Infobox Network (that is, either erasing the ""name"" line or leaving it blank, under any of the recent iterations of the header code), it leaves a little rogue vertical mark in the linespace above the logo image, insteading of eliminating the linespace altogether.

" ""Life"" vs. ""good behaviour"" This article needs a lot more citing, in general. However this recent edit seems problematic. It needs to be cited, or better, amplified to say something like ""good behaviour"" (US Constitution: Article 3, section 1, second sentence) which is effectively ""life"".

He edited without a valid talk page discussion. You would have slapped a tag on the page. I merely indicated that his argument was based on an ad hominem and removed the edit.I wasn't looking for an editor who agreed with me, I was looking for an editor who would spend more than 10 minutes researching the subject and making a snap judgement. The third party source I included indicated that Underwood had posted regularly to alt.slack and the newsgroup post that is undeniably by Ivan Stang (his ip. his style. his sense of humor. responses to his post by other church members serving to indicate his identity) demonstrated that Underwood was a subject of levity in the Church. The third link I included had several dozen posts between Underwood and church members. The third party source indicates that these posts were by Underwood. Therefore they are verified by a third party source. You just were too lazy to bother. Now you're too irate to bother.

"no seriousy.  the only thing i think actually did or said against your precious wikipedia policies was saying that ""if i really had my way, half of you would be shot"".  ignoring for a while the fact that i was obviously joking, it happens to be my religious belief that the human race on a whole would be much, much better off if 95% of the population died tomorrow.  that doesn't mean i go around killing people, or making specific death threats against individuals.  and don't you actually have the sense to realize that if someone says ""OH MY GOD YOU ARE SUCH A FUCKING IDIOT, JUST GO DIE ALREADY"" that they probably don't want you to die, or more accurately they don't care.  Very few people actually have the emotion required to sit and pray for the death of another person or group of people.  And I am not one of those people.If you really wanted to show off what a horrible and insensitive person I am,  edit, which was on a wiki talk page, is probably not the best.  Granted, nothing pisses me off more than people who see letters like я and щ and automatically assume that whatever is written is Russian.  The Cyrillic alphabet is used in many Slavic languages, as well as central asian former soviet republics, and even Mongolia.  So I called someone an idiot.  BOO FUCKING HOO.  maybe he could have said ""What language is that?"" instead of assuming that it was Russian.  However insulted he was by me calling him an idiot, I can guarantee you that I was at least 10 times as insulted by him calling that Russian.  I am a proud, native Russian, and will not have my culture besmirched with these allegations.Your other example how I am a bad contributor is what, a spelling correction?  Or was it the fact that my edit summary was how I felt about the sad fact that niggers can't spell? Don't even think about raising issue of my use of the word.  I live in Harlem.  Around here, that word is used like a comma.  And before you try to tell me the difference between ""nigga"" and ""nigger"", there is none.  It's called a dialect.  While for some purposes, it makes sense to write things phonetically as they are pronounced by the person saying them, I find it is usually clearer to spell properly.  Also, a nigger, to me at least, is not a ""black person"". I am not a racist. I do not even draw distinctions between people. In my holy opinion, there is a nigger inside of all of us.  People (like you, for instance) who take offense for no reason (i mean, was saying ""black people are stupid and i think they should be marginalized in society, tarred and feathered, strung up on trees, dragged through town by their enormous wangs, etc.""?  No.  And if that is what you heard, I'd like to know why.  Are you black?  98% of the black people I know personally use the word ""nigger"" more than I do.) are why we as a society still can't get over the silly idea that words are harmful.  Words are not harmful.  Ideas are harmful.  One particularly harmful idea is that certain words are so unspeakably horrible that nobody can be allowed to say them for any reason at all.  You want to end racism forever?  Stop freaking the fuck out every time you see the word ""nigger"".  SERIOUSLY.  I happen to be a Priest (and a Docktor), and saving humanity is just one of my many responsibilities.  Fucks like you make me hate it, but I still do it.  That's what a good person I am.I forgot what else I was going to complain about.  I mean, I could complain about everything on Wikipedia, not because I am uncivil, but because there are enough Wikipedos to make this community unbearable for normal, well-adjusted individuals such as myself.  If you look at all my page edits, they were all GOOD FOR THE ENCYCLOPEDIA.  Ok, there was one tiny exception - a long time ago, I saw someone changed a caption on Scottish fold to ""Winston Churchill"".  Someone else reverted it, and I reverted it back.  I felt it was an appropriate caption to that particular image.  But everything else was beneficial to improving the quality of the content.  I may be a little hard on people who are hung up on things that are wrong, but I only do what is right.  That is why I put it on my user page.  I don't do wrong things.  If you try to argue with me, you will be in for a world of hurt.  Butthurt, to be exact.  But you have nobody to blame but yourself.  Unlike you, I actually warn people first.  But no.  You fags have to be humorless, oversensitive, fascist wikipedos with your unwarranted self-importance and your administrative powers.  Well you can go fuck yourselves.

"Well, there was a hot war going on in the background of TYOLD (the Konfrontasi) - the whole ""Living Dangerously"" line was based around Sukarno's words ushering in of hot conflict against Malaysia, UK, etc. But on the point of Indonesian Civil War - at least at the beginning of '65, there was indeed some combat between the ""G30S"" forces and those loyal to Suharto. I'm of the opinion that the period of combat was brief, and that after Jakarta was seized by Nasution-Suharto loyalists the casualties were very lopsided - hence, why the PKI's Central Committee-in exile called it just a ""White Terror."" But of course, however, the same group criticized Aidit for not adhering to Mao's ""People's War"" doctrine - so one could imagine that there were those sectors of the PKI that were spoiling for a conflict. Hence, I titled it Indonesian Civil War rather than Indonesian White Terror or Indonesian Coup - it keeps things NPOV and open to different scholarly interpretations.By, I should point out that I have an interesting hard copy ""self critical"" document the PKI Central Committee published from China detailing what they perceived as their mistakes in '65 and attempts to re-establish the Party. Unfortunately, it is without copyright information printed (this was likely due to attempts to get around import restrictions during the U.S. Cold War). I am looking forward to contributing some choice quotes to round out Indonesian Civil War. At any rate, toodles.  "	0|0|0|0|0|0

British BC plugs don't conform to any British Standard, which is why they vanished from the market place when conformance with British Standards became mandatory for all electrical accessories. It would have been up to one of the manufacturers to get them added to BS 5042 (the then standard for BC lampholders, now replaced by BS EN 61184), but presumably no manufacturer thought the cost of the effort worth what they would make in sales. BC plugs can still be found in some other countries which use BC lampholders. Occasionally they can be found for sale in the UK, but strictly it's illegal to sell them now.	0|0|0|0|0|0

"great, but what I meant about weakest link is that I don't see an explicit connection to developments in noise music in the sources I've seen, have you got a source that place's something called ""post-industrial"" in the context of the history of noise music? (I'm presuming this is the umbrella term invented by music journalists to cover any music that is stylistically informed by industrial music yet is at the same time far enough removed to warrant the 'post' tag).Unless the sources are good on this, it's too divergent, in my opinion, to include right now. Some of what might be called post-industrial is not that far removed from pop music so it simply doesn't warrant inclusion. You might as well do a section on death-metal and its precursors, but this kind of bifurcatory dot connecting is hardly the best way forward; especially as the title of this article arose as a result of someone trying to define a single genre known as ""noise music"".Personally, I think it is perhaps a stretch too far to start covering any kind of music, or any composer/artist, that might have dabbled in a bit of noise making, and I don't think that is what should happen with this article, unless the claims are sourced, and that's why I mentioned already that we should try and stick as closely as possible to what the main sources dealing with the historical use of sound/noise in music have to offer. We now see a number of artists (for example Jeff Mills) being redefined as a post-industrial musicians?? and the sentence throws in the year 2000 despite the fact that Mills has been associated with techno for 20 years now. I find this kind of redefinition without strong sources problematic.   "	0|0|0|0|0|0

"There are actually four Lord Fairfaxes mentioned in this article. You have Martin's grandfather (5th Lord Fairfax), his uncle (6th Lord Fairfax), his other uncle (7th Lord Fairfax), and cousin (8th Lord Fairfax). Since the majority of this article deals with his uncle, the 6th Lord Fairfax, I've tried to disambiguate as best I can. In the prose, I've stated: ""Martin's uncle Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron (known as Lord Fairfax) owned the Northern Neck Proprietary land grant, which he had inherited from Martin's great-grandfather Thomas Colepeper, 2nd Baron Colepeper in 1719."" The 6th Lord Fairfax was known as ""Lord Fairfax,"" so I've tried to start this out in the prose so that the reader will know it refers to the 6th Lord Fairfax.

.This whole conversation is rediculous as the colors on a flag are meant to represent different ideas or ideals. What we decide to call that color has everything to do with what is meant by that color. By calling it yellow one is neglecting to fully appreciate the meaning behind the choice of gold as a flag color is meant to convey an idea, that of eternal and original wealth and prosperity. It has nothing to do with being high and mighty regarding the naming of a color. That is a reactionary and frankly stupid position to hold. Flags are symbols meant to illustrate various ideas and they use images and colors, like all other forms of symbolism, to do this. Thus, the use of gold on a flag is in no way an attempt to sound more high and mighty, but rather a way to communicate.... you dolt	1|0|0|0|0|0

Hmmmm, are you suggesting stripping discussion of the pentarchy in the lead or are you suggesting different phrasing (if so what do you recommend)?My understanding is that it was Constantinople's position that Rome objected to (which, granted was at the core of Justinian's pentarchy) but not the idea of the patriarchate system as a whole. Even so, though, it's not like Rome pulled out of future councils or in any other substantial ways severed itself from the emperor at that time. In other words, it is certainly true that there were many violent disagreements, some of which led to temporary schisms, but to my understanding Justinian's system, even if not everybody liked it, became a practical reality (one that indeed helped fuel the fire that pushed Rome further and further away).	0|0|0|0|0|0

What is and what is not church doctrine is a fuzzy thing and, as you likely know, has always been the case. Many things that church members believe to be ""doctrine"" is not, but cultural doctrines promulgated by church members. In any case, the teachings of Smith and what he emphasized are fuzzy enough that many people thought his earlier teachings were more accurate, or that he changed doctrines, or that the current church misunderstood his teachings on many matters. We have to balance this to be historically accurate, with what is believed and taught today. Not an easy task. I'm open to suggestions in how to change wording.

" November 2007 (UTC)It seems that either you do not understand, either you are of bad faith. Let's make it simple:According to Encyclopaedia Judaica (Jerusalem, 1972), not I, the great argument of the Reform rabbis in Frankfurt (1843) was ""God ordered circumcision to Abraham, not to Moses""; in other words God's COMMANDMENT to Abraham is circumcision, God's COMMANDMENTS to Moses do not order circumcision; in other words:- God's One Commandment to Abraham = circumcision.- God's Ten Commandments to Moses = not even one for circumcision!The rabbis, not I said so! Therefore, wholly and seriously documented, I wrote it into the main article but WP and S rub it out. This is an insane violation of the wiki rules.Now, in order to enlighten the main article, the 2nd Commandment topic of this ""Discussion""  introduces my ""discovery"" (a child would do it). It says:- God's 2nd Commandment to Moses orders him: ""Do not circumcise.""But, contrary to the saying of PW and S, I never attributed this to the Reform rabbis.Conclusion: who forgot to take their medicine, for several days now? Not I!The ethical question involved about this discussion is: ""How can the wiki support a very obviously childish lie just because this lie has been carried along for millennia?"" Think about it! If you are responsible persons, you cannot publish an obvious lie without warning your readers, which I am doing.Sigi's request to WP and S: ""Circumcise your heart, eyes, ears and pen, not your peco!"" because yes, this criminal violation of Moses 2nd Commandment is being done every day in the USA to baby boys. It even has been done to an Oregon girl, in 1950 (see http://www.aesculapiuspress.com/ - Books – The rape of innocence); indeed a good American mother cannot want her beloved daughter be deprived from circumcision when her beloved son gets it, can she?

I was requested to provide an opinion here by ComfyKem. Everyone agrees that virus species and genera are inherently different. Usual practice for a genus with a single species would be to construct a single article to cover both, and that's sensible where the pair would otherwise duplicate each other. However, there's no reason in principle why each can't have an article  as long as there is sufficient distinctive, reliably sourced material in each to merit that. This appears to be the case here, just about (though bloating the Lloviu virus article with speculative information about what the virus particle might look like appears unhelpful). If we are to have a single article on a genus with a single species, as Plantdrew suggests, it would probably be best to have it at the species name, as that is what the bulk of readers are most likely to search for.	0|0|0|0|0|0

When I say peer review, I mean by those in academia - not our own peer review process. Your claims that they are an author's POV are spurious at best. The books he used are highly researched publications by noted members of their fields who spent years researching this subject.You will need some serious sources to counter those presented by Chris. Also, before you go challenging his research, I wish to remind you of Chris' bona fides: he is a published author who is finishing his PhD in Gastronomy from Boston University, a major American University.

About my deletion requests... Hello Schutz. First of all, I should introduce myself. I am pl (sysop), de, simple, fr, nl and commons:user:odder (sysop). On en wiki I'dont have this username because of it was taken by, I guess, one of my opponents. So simply write to my odder. Second, I think that these redirects are simply stupid (and not linked from the main space, too). Why? The good redirect is redirecting from the shorter to longer article name, not from the longer to shorter.

"I understand the confusion. You would think that since a primary source is a first-hand account, it would be the most reliable. However, the person or group involved could have a biased viewpoint. Also, there may be multiple viewpoints on the event in question that differ from one another. That's when a secondary source comes in. A secondary source's author is ""one step removed"" from the event reducing the chance of bias, and often uses several primary sources to form an opinion, evaluation, and/or conclusion. Furthermore, secondary sources are more likely to be published – the editorial oversight of the publishing process is extremely valuable here. It helps us avoid original research. One of the biggest problems with Wikipedians relying on primary sources is that they often find themselves forming their own conclusions, whether intentionally or not, which would be considered original research. You can read more about why published sources are sought on Wikipedia at WP:RS and WP:SOURCE.    "	0|0|0|0|0|0

" Is this a press release? ==With her trademark pageboy bob haircut and sunglasses, Wintour has become an important figure in much of the fashion world, widely praised for her eye for fashion trends and her support for younger designers. Her reportedly aloof and demanding personality has earned her the nickname ""Nuclear Wintour"".I'm sorry but that reads ridiculous and has no sources to any of those claims. Who has widely praised her? Who says she is important? And the word reportedly, reportedly by whom? Where is a source for her nickname? Is her pageboy bob really trademarked?Also the following-She is the eldest daughter of Charles Wintour, editor of the London Evening Standard. Her father consulted her on how to make the newspaper relevant to the youth of the era.So she was a newspaper consultant? I find it hard to believe that her Father,a grown man, would consult a youth on how to make a newspaper relevant to anyone. Where are sources for this? I guess I will start looking for sources and removing non sourced statements tomorrow. If anyone wants to help please help me.

Because it is pretty much a crock as far as I'm concerned.  What about the notion of suggestion, which seems the major distincton between erotica and pornography.  By the definition you chose to attribute, a depiction of an individual in a suggestive pose (IE not a ""sexual act"") is exempt from being called ""erotica"" .

You left me a note a couple days ago about whether I thought Abp. Burk would be named a Cardinal. . .I don't really know, but I doubt it.  St. Louis is one of those diocese (Baltimore is the other that comes to mind) that sometimes has a Cardinal, but not always.  We have not had one as Abp. since Cardinal Carberry retired in the early 1980's (he died in about 1998).  I think as the church becomes less a European and North American church we will see fewer cardinals from small and mid-sized diocese like STL and more from Africa, Asia, and South America.  I also think the controversies over things like St. Stans make it less likely thatBurke would get picked for a red hat.	0|0|0|0|0|0

"No, I will make sure that will be removed permanently.  I will not do this for awhile to avoid violations, but hope that someone else will consider and agree.  There is no reason whatsoever to put ""the late"" in front of his name, I will list several reasons, and although I think that is somewhat POV, there are other reason as to why I remove the info:Everyone dies sometime - Does it really make sense to have an article about a past event and just put ""the late"" in front of everyone that has died?Poor writing - It's just sloppy/filler writing to put ""the late"" in place.  Would you ever see anyone referred to as ""the late"" in a print encyclopedia?Recentism - WP has a guideline/template that we should try not to capitalize too much on recent events and keep them in perspective.  Would it make sense 10 years down the road to still refer to him as ""the late""?  Let's make things as static as possible.Precedent - At one point, several dozen articles referred to Steve Irwin as ""The late Steve Irwin"", now, this is the only one that does (by doing a search), and there seems to be consensus about that.Knowledge of his death - Let's face it, a vast majority of people (especially those that would look for this article) know he is dead, and the few that may not be sure can click the link.  Maybe people don't want to know that he's dead or be reminded of it, and putting that acts as a spoiler.  Even Anna Nicole Smith had a few ""the lates"" put on pages of hers, and those have all been removed (a few by me, a few by others). ""Saving a click"" is not a valid reason for this, we should assume that the readers are smart, and things like that can go to the Simple English edition.Irrelevance - Why would the fact that he is dead be relevant to an article that talks about his programming?  His shows will probably be reran for many years to come, and the fact that he died somewhat unexpectedly makes no bearing on what he did on his programming.Well, this is my case, I would also like to point out WP:OWN, which I feel has been violated in these reverts.  I also am starting a discussion on WP:Words To Avoid to get some word from other editors to make sure that I am doing the right thing.  I am supremely confident that I am, and I look forward to improving the PETA article in the future.  "	0|0|0|0|0|0

Additionally (since this is apparently hard to find) the biography by Jon Krakauer refers to Pat Tillman as an agnostic and possibly even an atheist.

": Thanks for the edits.  I am not aware of any split in the US between ""higher"" doctorates and others.  The PhD (DPhil not awarded here in my experience) is typically a 5- or 6-year degree, but as that time period often includes MS-level classwork, it seems parallel to your PhD.  When awarded in the US, the DSc is the precise equivalent of the PhD.  The ranking you list  Divinity, Laws or Civil Law, Medicine, and Letters, and above Music  is at least not well known in the US.  (It would be helpful to include the degree names in the above list, since I certainly don't know them all.)  MD is, as you say, a professional degree (as is DrPH in public health).  I think the general attitude is to regard all doctoral degrees as on par, and honorary degrees as strictly honorary, and not pertaining to academic work.  This is something of a mess, isn't it?

"Danny your motives are clearly not about being more ""encyclopaedic"" as we have seen your methods time and time again. As the Wikipedia page says: "". . .You can quickly insert inline references to web pages by inserting a URL surrounded by single square brackets; this does not provide as much information to readers, but it is much better than not citing your sources at all"" Interestingly, I see you have only attacked and vandalized the Quotes website, and none of the Watchtower's multiple links, no surprise there with your gross bias screaming from the rooftops. As for the links to Quotes websites, they are extremely encyclopaedic, and the 1975 page has no commentary, but lists all the printed material about 1975, so as to give fair and reasonable coverage, rather than just a few selective quotes. They are all given their source, publication, date and page numbers for proof and reference. Your apparent fear and terror that the public might actually read what the Watchtower organization has written is very revealing. You clearly have an agenda to vandalize and ban free speech when it doesn't suit your agenda, not dissimilar to your religious organisation. I suggest you look inside and see why now after many months, you feel the desperate need to hide accurate, comprehensive, dated, quotes, direct and unaltered that have been published by the Watch Tower Society? If you can give all the 1975 publications from the Watchtower's website, then I'm sure many here will be only to happy to list that link, but I think you will find they refuse to give any information to the public about their less than flattering publications, and that is where we all need to see a comprehensive and fully documented source like the excellent quotes site on 1975. You have failed to substantiate any of your claims about the quotes site; merely saying ""it's not useful"" is a deadpan POV with no basis but your own fear of reality, and your desperate urged to manipulate the public.

Trevithj:   The reason sources discussing the negative feedback amplifier do not mention set-points, errors, and comparators is that they have no more relevance than the stock market.  The remarks of Black are perfectly clear and also make  no mention of these factors, nor do his patents. They are understandable as he intended them- the use  of feedback bypasses  the  inadequacies of the nonlinear, variable, and uncontrollable properties of the large-gain open loop amplifier, as very easily seen in the gain analysis that shows the closed-loop gain to be set at 1/β, as fixed by a resistor divider, for example, by making the closed-loop gain 'independent entirely'' of the open-loop gain.

":I can't quite figure it out. The system of numbering dynasties was developed by Manetho in the Thirtieth Dynasty, so it isn't often applied to later dynasties. But it looks like the second period of Achamenid rule, following the Thirtieth Dynasty, is sometimes called the Thirty-first Dynasty. One might count the Ptolemies as the Thirty-second Dynasty, but I don't know if any reliable sources do so. They're either called ""the Ptolemaic dynasty"" or ""the Ptolemies"" or ""the Lagides"". And counting them as number 32 instead of 33 would ignore the Argead Dynasty (Alexander the Great, his son Alexander IV of Macedon, and Philip III Arrhidaeus), which ruled briefly but probably as long as some of the minor numbered dynasties. I can't see any reason for counting the Ptolemies as number 34. Unless sources address the issue, I think attempts to give the Ptolemies a number should be left out of the article.   "	0|0|0|0|0|0

I don't have desperately strong opinions about what should be included other than the two most widely recognised songs of Lennon's solo career.

"You know what, forget it. The guy who was repeatedly changing the opening and led me to post what was previously here, because he repeatedly refused to answer the simple question of why (except of course to start SHOUTING) has reported me for not being civil. How ironic is that. Rather than have a long detailed discussion here about which opening is better, I'll simply point out that in the current version, even after you read the entire first paragraph, you still don't have a clue why this article exists. You do find out what Marco Rodríguez does for a living though. So yay for that. I guess once you get to the end, you do get some idea why this has been such a big deal, but that's assuming you haven't fallen asleep, or shot yourself, having read the same four words - Brazil, Germany, biggest & loss (and their million variants), multiple times. Seriously, if people here think what's currently serving as an opening to this article summarises the key points in an engaging and professional way, perhaps you need to get a job where your actually paid to write for a living. It's not quite garbage, but it's not good. And please stop justifying such poor/dull/repetitive/trivial writing with the claim the alternatives are ""unencyclopedic"", frankly you couldn't be more wrong. There's no serious disagreement out in the world that this defeat was a shock result and a national humiliation - that will be upfront in the key summary of every decent source writing about this match, both now and in 20 years time. If you don't want it to be in this one, please think of a better reason than ""unencyclopedic"", if only that the victims might have a clue what it is you actually mean.That said, on the offchance anyone with any ability for writing gets around to working on this article, here's what the opening should look like, if you're trying to engage the reader while summarizing the key points. It's not perfect, but it's a hell of a lot better than the crap people fought tooth and nail to replace it with.Brazil 1–7 Germany was the shock result of the first semi-final of the 2014 FIFA World Cup men's international football tournament, played on 8 July at the Estádio Mineirão in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. It broke Brazil's 62-match home unbeaten streak in competitive matches going back to 1975, and equalled their biggest margin of defeat, tied with a 6–0 loss to Uruguay in 1920, leading it to be described as a national humiliation. The game also saw Germany score the most goals in World Cup history, their 223 overtaking Brazil's 221. Their second goal meant Germany's Miroslav Klose reached 16 World Cup goals, overtaking Brazil's Ronaldo as the tournament's all-time record goalscorer. The game was subsequently referred to by the press as the Mineirazo, evoking the spirit of the Maracanazo in which Brazil unexpectedly lost the 1950 FIFA World Cup on home soil to Uruguay."	0|0|0|0|0|0

" My reply that you have deleted in a fascist manner from the Nicosia Discussion page....l Nicosia and discrimination against Greek contributors and the Greek character of the cityDear Salvio,You have accused me of abusive behaviour against other users and consequently blocked me from editing the article on Nicosia for a 24 hour period.May I draw to your attention that it is fairly obvious that those three users namely Seb az86556 , Seric2 and Chesdovi are clearly constantly creating a picture of Nicosia as a decadent muslim city that serves their religious beliefs and are all clearly hailing form Turkish backgrounds.There is a constant undermining of the city´s Greek identity i.e. whenever a Greek flag appears in any single picture the aforementioned users delete that picture instantaneously and prefer to throw in pictures of the flag of ""shame"" and occupation that is equivalent to a legalisation of a human crime of continuous brutal occupation of the island of Cyprus by the Turkish army.The Greek flag is OMNIPRESENT in the Republic of Cyprus whether some people like it or detest it but this is the reality and an Encyclopedia that wishes to be UNBIASED should depict the REALITY and not the subjective views of a minority of readers that are furthermore based on extremist religious and nationalistic views. On the other hand, such users do find it appropriate to throw in pictures using the Turkish and the ILLEGAL, yes illegal according to United Nation referendums flat of the non-recognised internationally illegal self-proclaimed state of the so-called TRNC.It is totally UNACCEPTABLE to have extremist nationalistic individuals, that strategically reached the level of administrators, deteriorating all the time the article on the city of Nicosia, promoting an unrealistic Turkish character and undermining the Greek character of the city AND at the same time having an ADDITIONAL article on ""North Nicosia"" that is depicting a totally FALSE picture w.r.t the city. The TRNC is illegal, not recognised by any state other than Turkey and some terrorist states that are non-democratic and yet Wikipedia has a page on Northern Nicosia by supposedly administrators that support the unification of Cyprus. This is clearly a major distortion of their intentions and a huge lie in that an individual that pretends to be a neutral aribtrator and a supoporter of reunification cannot have a separate page on Northern Nicosia stressing how Turkish it is and then go and literally destroy everything in the proper page for Nicosia and emphasize the Turkish character of the city, talk about the tension and the division of the city all the time and undermine the Greek character.This is clear nationalistic and racial discrimination against the indisputable Greek character of the area controlled by the Republic of Cyprus and furthermore it is downgrading for the Republic of Cyprus the mere fact that Wikipedia has a site that is CONSTANTLY vandalised by several ethnic Turkish extremists and Wikipedia users support such discriminatory behaviour.In the light of all of this, I shall stop contributing to Wikipedia as I consider it downgrading for my own self. Furthermore, I do not wish to participate in an ""encyclopedic"" project that is totally biased and discriminatory.Marcobadotti (talk) "	0|0|0|0|0|0
"So his summaries weren't ""AS"" antagonistic.  So whichever person is a bit more antagonistic gets the warning.  Good to know.  On to your second claim: I still don't understand how *I* have a ""pattern of edit warring,"" but Olyeller doesn't when: (1) I added a completely valid and relevant and referenced sentence; and (2) OlYeller repeatedly removed it for NO VALID REASON; and (3) Olyeller falsely claimed in his summary that the issue was presented in the talk page.  So it's odd that falsifying summaries isn't considered a form of antagonism and/or worthy of a warning. The only reason OlYeller removed it is because he has a really big anti-Carbonator grudge.

" Request regarding current RfAr/Clarification There is an open Request for Clarification regarding a sanction decided at Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Case/Abd-William M. Connolley, see live link, or permanent link. is the only arbitrator to comment there so far. I agree with him, and, unless other arbitrators wish to address the issues raised, I support the close of this request with no finding or clarification. My reason for this: it is apparent that any useful clarification would require more discussion than can be accomplished at RfAr/Clarification, and that I was blocked while this request was pending, for comments made in the request itself, is an additional impediment.There is no need for extra debate or argument. I have stated that I am willing to accept a tighter restriction than the way in which I interpreted the sanction, pending clarification by ArbComm. So the status quo is that the restriction is tight, though not necessarily as tight as defined by the administrator who blocked me. I do not consider myself restricted from what the sanction explicitly permits, and I'd argue that he did so consider. I accepted Sandstein's decision (""clarification"") as a neutral administrator, pending ArbComm review, not Future Perfect's who was already involved, and I had already claimed that he was involved in dispute with me.I will continue to respect Sandstein's tightening as standing and binding on me, and will interpret this very narrowly but as originally stated, and it did permit legitimate comment before ArbComm, when I am an originating party, as is normal. Normally, I can, having filed, respond there to comments from other editors, also made there, which is what I did. ArbComm specifically allowed me to originate a case, and if I'm clearly involved as well, I see nothing in the sanction which requires me to avoid it.I will not use this as a loophole to drive trucks through carrying my opinion about disputes between other editors, and I will avoid, in such a filing, if it happens, unnecessary mention of disputes between other editors. Obviously, if I file a case claiming involved use of tools by an admin, I will present evidence of involvement and existing disputes or other reason that recusal would have been required, which would only mention other disputes peripherally, and which will not be an attempt to resolve those other issues.I hope that there is more clerk attention to an actual RfAr than there has been to the existing RfAr/Clarification, which, as it stands, includes an illegitimate edit by someone other than me to the material I filed. It's been pointed out by , with clerk attention requested, and nothing was done. Nevertheless, if the request is closed without action, it's moot. The real point here is that if clerks were following filings before ArbComm, surely this would have been noticed and reverted or moved, and possibly the editor warned.   "	0|0|0|0|0|0

For your information sir, feminism is merely the belief that women are equal to men. You've just stated that he does not care about the sex or race of individuals. He obviously disagrees with many feminists on certain issues, particularly abortion, but he believes men and women are equal, and thus, is a feminist.

March 2006 (UTC)Yes, the presentation of God and cosmology in TUB is exactly that and so is just a fact of the book. If one was to summarize it in one single sentence that would be the only way I can think of to describe it NPOV. NPOV though is somewhat nebulous with this book as we all have discovered because of the authorship, origin and unusual, unique presentation that has caused various types of POV to surface in debate - true, not true, religion, philosophy, etc. I searched in some online libraries, at the Library of Congress and even wrote to the Urantia Foundation to inquire about the history of its official categorization in hopes this would help. So far, I found it listed under scientific religion, religion, non-fiction, cults, and got lost with all the changes due to copyright issues and various changes in status at the LoC. The book itself says it is an epochal revelation, which is the fifth to the planet. It describes itself as clearing up misconceptions regarding God, deity, and divinity. Religious science, scientific religion, esoteric cosmology, religious cosmology, what? Perhaps just writing this in a paragraph would be useful. Answering this would help to streamline the rest of the article, while increasing it at the same time, I think. What are your thoughts? You know if we wrote that The Urantia Book is an epochal revelation containing religio-scientific cosmology... there would then start more POV debating.  00:34, 16	0|0|0|0|0|0

The opening section discusses the ""dynasty"" status of the Patriots, but hardly mentions the effect of the recent loss. This page has featured status for fair and proper discussion of important Patriots facts. However, the page now feels unbalanced and biased due to its brief and perfunctory coverage of this highly significant loss. It is beginning to feel like a protected fan page, as opposed to a balanced and factual discussion of important facts relating to the Patriots. Obviously the page should be protected from vandalism by Giants fans, but this page needs to acknowledge that the Patriots lost a game that many football experts are calling one of the greatest upsets of all time.  137.159.153.35  DLOMME 02/06/08Yup.  communicator/kills  Taunting Disguised as Factual Information Looking through the history of edits since the Super Bowl, a lot of information that's being added (and much of it since deleted) may be true, but the inclusion of it into the article seems more like a subtle attempt at taunting.  Is it really relevant that the Patriots are the first 18-1 team NOT to win the Super Bowl?    Who cares?  And believe me, I'm no Patriots fan (they've been a thorn in my team's side since last season's playoffs), but this is supposed to be an encyclopedia entry, not a fan forum.  This page should be locked from any further edits for awhile, unless something TRULY relevant to the Patriots should suddenly occur.   Actually, protection is not something to be taken lightly.  Being an admin (and even though I am a die-hard Pats fan myself), the level of problematic edits to this article, while high, is not so bad that we haven't been able to keep up with it by rollbacks and undos.  .talk.contribs FARI've nominated the article for Featured Article review since a lot of the content that was there when it was nominated has now been moved elsewhere.

Whenever a Superbowl loss is mentioned, the opposing team and score are given.  When it gets to the part about the Patriots winning Superbowls not only are the teams/scores not given, but it doesn't even say that they won them.  ie: ""Under Belichick, the team went to''' three Super Bowls in four years...""  It should be consistant one way or the other.The sentence, ""The Patriots, however, were defeated by the New York Giants in Super Bowl XLII, after winning the first 18 games of their 2007 season.""  is very clumsily tacked on to the first section.

Indeed: “Learning curve.” I am amazed at how much learning I had to do in order to get the wiki privatized and fully operational.First off, I wanted to make an iron-clad-security main page, like ArbCom’s wiki. That wasn’t too terribly difficult but there is a gaping hole in MediaWiki’s security in the default installation whereby all uploaded files (generally images) in a completely private wiki can be directly accessed by anyone familiar with MediaWiki merely typing a URL path. That took some reading and trial & error. MediaWiki’s excuse is that “♬♩ MediaWiki is designed to be open to everyone, maaaan. It’s—like—about *openness*. ♬” The thing is, those who don’t care to think about security, wouldn’t mind if images cannot be viewed via intelligent URL typing. However, those making a private wiki who do care wouldn’t want them viewable by I.P.s.And then thumbnails of images wouldn’t work no matter what I did to LocalSettings.php file. Like many things, I would go to talk pages on MediaWiki and discover there have been many others wrestling with the same issues. It turned out that ImageMagick has been omitted from recent builds of MediaWiki. Moreover, installing ImageMagick isn’t a matter of dropping files and folders into the /wiki using FTP; it’s a Linux installer rpm and only the webmaster can do that.And, after all that is done, there are bunch of gotta-have templates like Template:!xt, Template:-, Template:-/doc, Template:Hilite, Template:Nbhyph, Template:Nowrap, and Template:Xt. I think I have all the gotta-haves now. I was the shepherding author/sponsor on a bunch of them so I’m fond of them.I can’t complain about *free* stuff. MediaWiki is an amazing product that few commercial interests could match for under $1500. I’ll take the poor documentation associated with open-source software any day.	0|0|0|0|0|0

" Maybe irrelevant wasn't the ideal word choice. I wouldn't remove a photo of a Boston-located school from the Boston page, but I'd be a bit skeptical of its inclusion. It's just that there are something like 50 schools in the metroboston area. Even if you limit it to the more notable ones: MIT, Harvard, BC, BU, Berklee, Emerson, Suffolk, others I'm probably forgetting, which one do you pick? You can't put an image for every campus into that section, so which one is sufficiently representative? Also, I get the impression there's a minor status war between BC or BU (and probably other schools) regarding which one is depicted as the ""best"" school on wikipedia, so I think edits like the BC photo addition that could potentially be construed as marketing should be closely scrutinized.

I refer to people's constantly taking the words of Jimbo as policy, the idea of removing any userbox with a political point of view is his point of view.  That's at the core of this problem, you did not notice that an admin skipped over the tfd process and speedied something when there is no rule explicitly against having an opinion in a userbox?  Rather, there is Jimbo saying there shouldn't be any.  I completely understand that he started this, but he is not owner of it, a foundation was set up, perhaps you've heard of it - the Wikimedia Foundation.  I didn't say you had that same point of view, I'm saying that I was just telling the people who do to fuck off.  I made no attack on any editor, that you perceive it as such is truly sad, but such is life.  Perhaps with time you will learn the intricacies of the language.  If one does not want personal pages on a site, one should avail oneself to modify the source code in order to remove them from the site rather than complain that they're being used.  People who overstep the proper bound of their position should die, that I have encountered multiple administrators so far doing so does lead to the desire to fuck off, but I'm not done here.	0|0|1|0|0|0

" Silent letters The O in ""opossum"" is spelled but not pronounced. It is a silent letter, just like the H in the word ""honest."" The articles ""a"" and ""an"" are correctly based on the first pronounced letter, not simply the first letter. So, you have the phrase ""an honest man"" not ""a honest man,"" even though H is a consonant. Likewise, the phrase should be ""a opossum"" not ""an opossum,"" again based on the first pronounced letter. Therefore, I will go through the Article changing ""an opossum"" to ""a opossum."" The O in ""opossum"" is no different from the H in ""honest.""   "	0|0|0|0|0|0

"I enjoy lacrosse and I am interested in UNC lacrosse history and all the cool facts too. You guys have a lot of facts, achievements, names, tournaments and events ,etc. It has been stated already, but just make sure to really sort those things out into categories or sections to make the viewer more satisfied to what they are looking at and reading. It's more of just a blob of information being thrown at me with cool facts thrown in. You can separate the tournaments like ""ACCs"" and ""NCAAs"" and then list what happened or what awards were accepted. Also, maybe you could start off with where lacrosse started or came from, or just highlight the word lacrosse with a reference. Then perhaps inform the reader a bit about the history of UNC lacrosse. Could also have a section of UNC's present lacrosse team and their status to really keep the reader up to date with UNC lacrosse. Otherwise, keep finding more stories and information about UNC lacrosse and be sure to organize and really make it flow all together. In addition to that, don't forget to reference your sources at the bottom and after information you have found along with access dates and names, etc. Keep it up and it will all come together great I'm sure.

"I was typing the response when you visited the talk page.  It is the nature of Wikipedia to make a choose between users and so my comments were eliminated.  What I basically stated is that the material probably should NOT be in the article, the reasoning against her nomination needs to presented in a balanced NPOV manner.  Having its own section with each point starred is not NPOV.  Also, there must an attempt to provide the reasons FOR her nomination also, that was not present.  Also, the comments were conclusionary, they did not provide the reasoning.  For example, the LA Times quote stated that she is bad.  Whoa!  That's an elementary school argument.  There was no explanation on WHY JRB is so ""bad.""  that is NOT a NPOV presentation.  So go ahead provide the arguments and thinking against JRB, but provide the arguments and thinking FOR JRB also.  And conclusionary statments just don't cut it.  Your contracts professor wants to hear 'why' the contract is void, he/she does not just want to hear you say the contract is void. Best, "	0|0|0|0|0|0

"Well, I am not trying to pick a fight ) but I have NPOV issues with this article.  It reads  at the moment  like a celebration of scientific progress.  I have two problems: first, it moves too easily from science as a generic activity all people engage in, to science as a specifically Western project.  Second, although there has been progress in science in that there is some accumulation of knowledge, the history of science is rather more complicated than that.One way to deal with this (if others find my criticisms valid) is to distinguish in the article between what we know about changes in scientific method and knowledge (from Aristotle to Bacon to Comte to Popper; from Aristotle to Darwin to Mendel to Mayr; from Aristotle to Newton to Einstein and Planck; etc, on the one hand, and various discussions over how to study and conceive of the history of science (i.e. issues in historiography and the sociology of science), on the other.  For example, I think everyone agrees that Aristotle, Newton, Einstein and Planck are real people who lived at different periods of time and made different claims about the world  but I think different people have vastly different ways of telling the story that connects these people and their claims.  I'd hope a good article on ""the history of science"" would inform me of these issues, and provide me with the different ways of understanding the movement from one period in science to another.I am no expert on this but I really hope someone who feels very confident of their grasp of, say, Thomas Kuhn and Bruno Latour, could reorganize and develop this article in a way that takes their claims about science seriously, as well as the claims of those with opposing views.I am glad Ed has begun this article, it can be really important and it is a needed contribution.

I don't mean to intrude, but I have noticed the same, W.  There is a solution, but it's the baddest of bad words, on Wikipedia: deadlines.  The vast majority of words written by journalists and academicians weren't written because they wanted to.  Version 1.0 is moving along, and the Germans are almost ready to issue their printed, 50K-article, 1000-printed page Bertelsmann (Random House) encyclopedia, having been hard at work on the printed version since 2004.  Not getting a core of publishable articles on Wikipedia is simply not an option; it will be printed in some form or another, and as soon as it looks like someone else is beating us to it in this new wiki-world we've created, my guess is we'll get something out the door, if we have to hire content experts or translate the German printed encyclopedia to do it.  Every wikiproject should be thinking about these things. - Dan  (mistakes)	0|0|0|0|0|0

He is not a professor of semitic studies.  Also Lambert does not use the term ""widely"".  We are arguing about the ""accepted"" part.  Also the agreement was to list the four translations in terms of chronological order.  There seems to be a POV push here where-as I am just trying to list the four translations in terms of chronological order.  ChrisO has no proof that Wiesehofer has given an independent translation.  I know Wiesehofer's academic background well enough and he has articles mainly on Sassanid and Parthian Iran.  He is not a scholar of Akkadian or for that matter has published anything with regards to Akkadian translations.  There seems to be a gross violation of POV.

I noticed at the time that Tango reinserted the material you blocked me for adding to Giles Hattersley, but didn't think anything more of it, distracted as I was dealing with my own blocking. Now I've just seen elsewhere that you blocked him aswell. Subsequently reading the opinions at his talk page where he is unblocked after one hour, especially from other admins over what constitutes a personal attack, I am less than happy at how I got shafted over this incident, in which you have still failed to show I was intentionally attacking Giano - you seem to have absolutely no shame in levelling the same theory at Tango, an editor registered since Dec 2002, that you did to me, that the simple fact we are experienced editors that would have never seen a user's name linked in an article (I am still entirely unconvinced this is even true, especially for Wikipedia related text, but I have not researched it), we 'just should have known' it was considered a personal attack, blockable after no warning after making one edit/revert. Like I said, I would be willing to take it as 'ignorance is no defence' if this appeared in any policy text that I had just missed. And judging by his unblock request, he was not mistaken about what he was re-adding. So, quite clearly, you are attributing some malicious motive to me, that you aren't to Tango. Had I known of that discussion at the time, I have a good idea that things might have gone differently for me. It's not like I can do sod all about it now.	0|0|0|0|0|0

"Because I'm a pedant like this: In response to the last paraphrase, from 101 - 102 of Asbury's The Great Illusion, I'm tempted to call npov here. Asbury states that neither Pussyfoot nor his associates were ""punished or even reprimanded;"" further, he even states that they were ""justified."" However, there's a distinct difference between whether something is moral or justified. Anyway, I'm nitpicking. Here's the passage so you can judge for yourself:""Although Pussyfoot Johnson's political operations failed by a large margin to conform strictly to the Christian principles upon which the league had been founded, neither he nor others who employed similar 'variations' were ever punished or even reprimanded. It was generally felt by prohibition leaders that since the league acted as the agent of the churches and was therefore engaged upon the Lord's business, anything was justified which might help gain the ends desired by the Almighty.""

Are they supposed to showcase which fan took a shit with an el camino during some played out, washed up, tired gig? it makes no sense - I have plenty of quality videos that could be used to promote the el caminos, but you guys would rather  post another photo of a drunk fan who took a shit with an el camino.

"Cleanest City - It is surprising that Trivandrum is 73 out of 250. But, that surely is not a good ranking. Like Aarem suggested, being in the Top 10 deserves to be called 'one of the cleanest'. Also, cleanliness is not just about 'clean', it is about pollution, waste treatment etc. I suggest that 'one of the cleanest' should be removed.Best Airport- I am not sure what this means. This tag was given well before the new Terminal was inaugurated. I cannot understand how one could rate the old TRV terminals as one of the best! If looks is the yardstick here,most of the airports have modern terminals now and we should wait for a ranking of all the new terminals. Also, the statement does not say on what grounds it is the best airport - in terms of - revenue, traffic, profits, passenger traffic, facilities? If you would like to retain it, please be more specific and of course have the references ready.Cheapest and Closest option - I would suggest rephrasing this to ""one of the closest options to Maldives and Sri Lanka and the only direct option to Maldives. You can always use a connecting flight is what I am trying to say. For instance, someone in the UAE can fly to Colombo and catch a flight from there to MV. - MountainWhiskey  "	0|0|0|0|0|0

First off, I am not inserting my personal point of view just the facts. I don't know where you got your facts from but they are incorrect. As a life long resident of Miller, having both parents from Miller I am well aware of the boundaries of Miller. and your account is false...Also, I am not talking of this ORIGINAL TOWN of Miller or is supposed boundaries but The Miller Beach Area today is made up of many neighborhoods to simply call Miller Beach a Neighborhood of Gary makes the very notion of Miller smaller than it really is... I don't have agenda here. I just don't want my home town slighted by mis-information. It is the word Neighborhood that is of issue. Miller Beach has several Neighborhoods... It was settled almost 100 years before Gary was established. It is town that has been annexed. It is not a neighborhood of Gary. It existed before Gary. These are historical facts. Is Miller under the municipal control of the City of Gary? YES...Is it an area within the political boundaries of Gary, Yes... is it part of Gary? No	0|0|0|0|0|0

Senior descendant of Victoria & Albert? Is he really the senior male-line dynastic descendant of Victoria & Albert? Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester is the most senior male-line male descendant of Victoria & Albert as he is the surviving son of Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester and, as the Duke's two elder brothers, Edward and Albert (who reigned as George VI) had no sons, is since the death of his elder brother, William in 1972, the senior male-line male grandchild of George V, who was the surviving son of Edward VII, the first son of Victoria & Albert. Prince Andreas is a descendant of Leopold, Duke of Albany, who was Victoria and Albert's fourth son and Edward VII's youngest brother. Thus, he can't be considered as the senior male-line descendant of Victoria and Albert but, through dynastic changes in succession with renounciation of rights to the throne of Coburg by the future Edward VII and the Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught, he is the current titular Duke and thus is, with no doubt, the head of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Nonethelles, his British cousins from the Windsor family are agnatically senior to his family. We can say that Prince Andreas is the senior male-line descendant of Prince Albert in right of the former realm of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, as the elder lines of his descendants (thourgh Edward VII and Arthur, Duke of Connaught, now extinct in male-line) renounced their rights to it, but definitely he is not Prince Albert's senior male-line descendant in general.	0|0|0|0|0|0

If you want to preserve the claim and encourage other editors to work on it, put it in the talk page (here), or just link to it in the article's history from the talk page.

Once again, you don't know what you are talking about!

"The removed paragraph Slovakization is often rationalized as a response to forced magyarization, which happened mainly after the Ausgleich (Compromise of 1867). While no one now considers magyarization a positive trend, for several reasons the rationalization of slovakization as a response to it is questionable: magyarization happened during the times of the monarchy, and it happened in a time period when human rights were not considered nearly as universal as now. Slovakization is happening since then and it was as severe under communist dictatorship as it is now in democraticI have removed this paragraph, not because I would necessarily disagree, but because this is a speculative formulation (a ""POV"" in wikipedia terminology) not suitable for an encyclopaedia. If this was an undisputed topic, maybe such formulations could work, but since that is not the case, it is definitely better to stick to pure sourced data.  "	0|0|0|0|0|0

" Response to third opinion request:Hi, I'm here to give your third opinion.  I think it's important to keep in mind that this article is titled ""Common English usage misconceptions"".  It's not ""Common English mistakes according to professional typography standards"".  It is clear - to me at least - that the hypen is often misused.  There's no dash key on my keyboard.  I know how to make a dash, however, —.  But I do web dev and work for a printing company. And I just started a sentence with ""but"", and this one with ""and"".  I know all these things are wrong - but they are convenient - and I'm writing this somewhat humorous third opinion for a few guys on an article talk page.  So, in my mind, the question is whether this is a misconception, or just ignorance.  I believe that to properly call something a misconception, it must be believed to be a rule, when in fact such a rule is not correct.  I've never heard anyone say, ""just use hyphens for everything"".  It has only become the default, because we have no dash keys.  So I would lean toward excluding this entry, unless you want to change the scope of the list to include all common mistakes, not just misconceptions.  Hope this helps.   "	0|0|0|0|0|0

"I was just released from prison on December 18, 2009.  During the period ending about November 4, 2009, I engaged in a 101-day hunger strike.  (Actually, 100 and 2/3 days:  Started 221 pounds, ended up an estimated 171 pounds).  Generally, I drank two cups of milk in the morning, and drank water as needed.  I was never force-fed.  Nor, oddly enough, was I ever hungry, or in appreciable discomfort.  I was examined, almost daily, by prison medical staff.  Probably the reason that I did so well was that I understood that the most important thing is to maintain the body's electrolytes (calcium, potassium, sodium, magnesium, phosphate), and to consume just enough amino-acids to supply neurotransmitters. (If you merely drink water, after a couple weeks you'll lose enough electrolytes to cause an imbalance, and you'll feel terrible.  Most people attribute this to not eating, but I learned that it's actually due to the electrolyte imbalance, NOT the lack of calories.)  At the time, the longest hunger strike I'd ever heard of was referred to in the Capote book, ""In Cold Blood"", by Perry Smith, in the early 1960's:  93 days.  I could probably have gone two more months.     "	0|0|0|0|0|0

"::::This ""poll,"" while doubtless entertaining to BBC audience in England, and perhaps of some interest, is not a conventional poll, and certainly no reputable polling organization would offer such results as a scientific measure of pubic sentimentFurther, it's presented as if it reflects a historical trend in public opinion  as if according to a scientific measurement, Scott's popularity had declined over a period of time. However, there are no comparable measures from previous years presented (presumably because there aren't any).Had the BBC conducted a similar call-in program in 1955, '65, etc., perhaps Scott would have been more popular in earlier years. I bet in earlier years, he would have ranked much higher than Boy George, et alia, than during early 21 Century broadcast ""poll"".....Am I at least partly stating a semi-plausible case for why this may be non-useful information?

The romanization of Thai names is a pain, there are lots of different schemes, and even though there is one official scheme (which has many weaknesses, see Royal Thai General System of Transcription) by far not all texts from government follow it - especially on websites. There is a list of recommended spellings, yet I somehow cannot find the link right now, but at least for the letters I think I have followed that list. I don't know by which rule the buri (which means town) is spelled with blank or without, it's confusing me as well. As soon as I find that list again I will check again if I did all spelling correctly...  19:27, 5 Mar 2005 (UTC)	0|0|0|0|0|0

I'm not incorrect. Labor cost is labor itself. The cost of building anything is the labor itself that you exerted to build it. If you charge more labor for something that took less labor to build, then you're not being equitable according to Warren. It's very simple and straightforward.	0|0|0|0|0|0

The neutrino will for several months if not years be the focus  of one of the highest-stakes scientific investingations of all time.

The small supply of water in the bore wells can be used effectively. The existing pumps can be used with one regulator to adjust the capacity of pump/speed as per the supply of water in the bore wells which will maintain the continuity of flow; thereby the main principle of getting maximum water from the bore can be achieved i. e. Q outlet ≤ Q inlet. All the bore wells which are not in use because of its small supply of water will also start to function as per their capacities of inlet discharge.	0|0|0|0|0|0

@: I feel like I can't improve upon this interaction while not understanding from the people involved (the person I said it to and  who did the block 18 hours after the conversation was over).  If as  said, that blocks are meant to be preventative not punitive, then I think its fair for me to ask questions about it - to see where the situation went wrong. When I posted that message, and I still haven't heard from the block admin that its content was the issue, I thought I was making an attempt to improve upon the interaction with this editor by trying to speak with him on a sincere and personal (human to human) level and made the comment on his user page in order to make contact with the person, rather than having us both resort to the standard drawn-out wiki-procedures. So far, at least on-wiki, that editor has had no reaction to what I said, while people visiting my page here after the block have had incredibly intense reactions. I just have to ask if its fair that I be punished so intensely for their reactions to what I said, especially when there is a power disparity with them able to block based on their reactions, and me only able to appeal on this page.	0|0|0|0|0|0

CEREMONIES AT MINDROLLING MONASTERY Vajrasattva Drubchen- 10th Day of 1st Lunar MonthThe Vajrasattva Drubchen is a seven day ceremony based on the Minling Dorsem or Mindrolling Vajrasattva ritual. Minling Dorsem is part of the Vajrasattva cycle of teachings discovered by Chogyal Terdag Lingpa. The Drubchen is held every year for seven days beginning on the 10th day of the 1st lunar month.This grand ceremony is performed to purify the negativities of all sentient beings, particularly of the deceased. On the 15th day of the 1st lunar month sangha gathers to perform a special ceremony for those who have died within the previous year.Kagyed Drubchen- 24th Day of 1st Lunar MonthBeginning the 24th day of the 1st lunar month, the Drubchen is a ten-day ceremony. It is based on the Kagyed De-Sang Du Pa terma that is one of the treasure teachings discovered by the renowned Terton Nyang Ral Nyima Woezer and later revived by Terdag Lingpa.When Terdag Lingpa was about to pass into Parinirvana, it is said that he asked his disciples and sangha members not to weep but to realize the truth of impermanence. He then instructed them that if they had devotion for him and truly wanted to benefit beings they should do the Kagyed ceremony each year. This, he said, would benefit the Dharma and all sentient beings. In accordance with the instructions of the great Bodhisattva, from that time on, the Kagyed Drubchen has been held every year, now being performed at the Mindrolling monastery in India.The final day of the ceremony is on the 2nd day of the 2nd lunar month, which is the Parinirvana Day of Terdag Lingpa. There are lama dances in the evenings of each day’s ceremony. The drubchen ends in the evening of the 3rd day of the 2nd lunar month with the ritual of Bgodrub Lenchog, the Receiving of Siddhis Ceremony and Marme Monlam (butter lamp ceremony). These are open to the public.Tsechu Drubchen- 8th Day of 2nd Lunar MonthSince the heat in India makes it impossible for the dances in this ceremony to be performed in the 5th lunar month as they were in Tibet, this Drubchen is held for three days beginning on the 8th day of the 2nd lunar month. The tsechu Drubchen marks the birth of Guru Padmasambhava and is done in accordance with the terma, Lama Sangha, which was discovered by the great treasure master Guru Chowang and later revived by Terdag Lingpa.On the 10th day of the 2nd lunar month,a full day’s Lama Dance is performed in accordance with the ritual of Lama Sangdu. These lama dances are renowned for their blessings and are the foremost examples of the lama dances in Tibet in their original form. Many people come from all over to receive the blessings of this great ritual. On the next day, His Holiness Mindrolling Trichen would bestow a long life empowerment to the public in order to dispel the obstacles and difficulties in the coming year. The tradition has been observed down to the present day since the Tsechu Drubchen was performed in Mindrolling. It has been an opportunity both for everyone to receive the blessings of the Mindrolling Trichen and for the coming together of the monastic and lay sangha.Saga Dawa Drubchen- 15th Day of 4th MonthThis Drubchen held on the 15th day of the 4th lunar month marks the birth, enlightenment and mahaparinirvana of Shakyamuni Buddha, one of the most important occasions throughtout the Buddhist world. Special prayers, rituals and butter lamp offerings are made during the ceremony.Tel-da Tsechu- 10th Day of 5th Lunar MonthThis auspicious ceremony marks the birth of the Guru Mahaguru Padmasambhava. This drubchen is performed for three days in accordance with the Lama Sangdu text from the 8th to the 10th day of the 5th lunar month. Suring the Drubhcen, secial feast practices are done and the Tsog ( feast offerings) is distributed to the general community.Yarne, the Summer Retreat- 15th Day of 6th Lunar Month to 30th Day of the 7th Lunar MonthThis is the rain retreat for one and a half months from the 15th day of the 6th lunar month to the 30th day of 7th lunar month. The retreat is held in accordance with the instructions of the Buddha in the Vinayana Sutra directingall monks to observe certain restrictions and engage themselves in meditation and practices for the period. Khenpos and Lopons give teachings each day and “So-Jong” or confessions are offered by the sangha during this retreat. Many butter lamps are offered and pujas are done during the retreat. On the evening of the 30th, the last day of the retreat, selected monks give teachings and expound the Dharma to the community. The retreat is usually followed by a 3-5 day holiday break for the monks.Drubchen for the Nine Dharmapalas- 27th Day of 7th Lunar Month	0|0|0|0|0|0

There are many inaccurate statements being posted here. Far too many, i don't have time to correct all of them. The BNP was modernised by Nick Griffin and has no links to Holocaust denial or Nazism. Digging up 20 or 30 year old quotes is irrelevant. You can do that for all parties as many change their ideology. The modern Labour party are not the traditional Labour party, just how the Conservative party are no longer traditional Conservative Tories. During the heydey of the British Empire the Conservatives were pro-imperialistic and supported the colonisation of other countries, do you think the modern conservatives under Cameron support that? Another example: The Green Party in UK used to strongly oppose drugs, yet now they support drug-use and want to ban the prohibition of drugs and support the possession, trade and cultivation of cannabis. So they went from being anti-drug to pro-drug. The modern BNP has no links to Holocaust denial. Secondly, the comment about Nick Griffin and the RAF bombings is a typical distortion of what he said by anti-BNPer's. What Nick actually said is that the RAF should not have bombed German innocents (children and woman) as many were murdered in the Bombing of Dresden. Likewise he also opposed the bombing of innocent British civilians by the Nazis. Also the last claim modern BNP members sieg heil, i presume was a comical claim. It has no basis in fact. BNP are strongly against Nazism and Fascism. If you want a real fascist organisation that would be the UAF (Unite against Freedom), who attack BNP members with clawhammers and other weapons etc. Is that democratic? You might not like someone elses political views but that doesn't give you a right to go out and attack them violently.	0|0|0|0|0|0

Mate, When I was training to be RNMH one thing they stressed above anything was that mental handicap definitely is not a medical condition. In fact one of the main things taught to us was that the medical model was a poor model for the care of mentally handicapped people, because the model is based on treatment, and mentally handicapped people cannot be cured. A model based on normalisation or social role valorization is more appropriate. How can such a vast collecion of disorders/abilities be a single medical condition? I don't mean to be contrary, and must admit to having left the profession some 14 years ago. 20:00, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)	0|0|0|0|0|0

Established on 20 February 1995 through Republic Act 7889, its mission is to bring to the people of Mindanao the UP standard of academic excellence and commitment to academic freedom, social responsibility and nationalism. Subsequently, the Board of Trustees of the U.P. System formally created U.P. Mindanao on 23 March 1995.	0|0|0|0|0|0
Hitler was innocent... There are several groups that want to rewrite history to make Germany the innocent player.  A particulary fine example of this nonsense is .Some of this article reads a bit weasily, that Germany was on the back foot and had to attack.I particularly note that the article stated that Hitler made a peace offer before the battle.  I changed this toOn 6 October, he may have made some type of peace offer to both Western Powers.  Any statement along these lines needs to be made very carefully, what were the offers, and what are the sources for the information.	0|0|0|0|0|0

Their lyrics focuses mainly on gore and Humor.BiographyThe band was formed in Rome in 1993. With the first line-up (Max - gurgling, Andrea - guitars, Fabio - bass, Marco - drums) under a different name Enthralment and recorded their first demo called Eulogy Of Burning Christ. The official sound was a slow and brutal death-metal influenced by Immolation and Incantation.Cryptic Soul Productions signed Enthralment released the 7"" Accursed In Divinity. However. the sound contained in the new tracks were defenitely more brutal oriented. As the musical direction was no longer the same as the beginning, it was useless to keep the old name. The one choosen for this new form of madness was Corpsegod. With a different name but same line-up, they recorded in 1995 the mini cd Opinion About Sorrow released by Torture Records. The mini cd contained 5 tracks of original and strange brutal death-metal. Ultrabrutal riffing with techno and industrial parts, splatter movies - Opinion About Sorrow a really vanguard record compared to the others on the death-metal scene.Though, the passion for the ultrabrutal death-metal in the band was getting higher and higher. The old line-up went to create a new band totally devoted to the brutal death-metal without compromises. A new band was born then, Corpsefucking Art. From the old line-up Andrea and Max were still there. After recording a 2 tracks promo with the new line up (Massimo - guitar, Marcello - drums, Edo - bass) and the track Molesting The Corpse for the underground splatter movie Sick-o-pathic soundtrack. The band played as support for Cannibal Corpse and Immolation for a show in Rome. Corpsefucking Art recorded their debut CD named A Puzzle Of Flesh for the italian label Sterminio Productions. Nine tracks of blasting ultrabrutal death-metal without mercy. An inhuman voice and a blasting riffing made A Puzzle Of Flesh known in the underground.In 2001 the line-up changed again. Andrea the only member from the first line up joined up with Marco (bass) and Stuart (drums). They recorded a new split CD with Goretrade Zombiecronomicon distributed by Coagulated Records. In april 2002, United Guttural Records took the license by Coagulated records and restamped the split cd with Goretrade, released with a completely new artwork.After being offered a contract by Forever Underground, Corpsefucking Art entered the studio to record their new full length Splatter Deluxe with the new second guitarist Marco Riccardi. Between the recording and the long wait to the new cd to be out, the band takes part in a lot of live performances including festival in Frankfurt with Lividity, Gorerotted, Inhumate, Pigstry, Nunwhore Commando 666, Mastic Scum, Master and Damnable and the rest of Europe in places like Sweden, France and Italy. The band is currently, in 2008, recording a new studio album and is aspected to come out early 2009.MembersPaolo Chiti - vocals (1995-)Andrea Cipolla - guitar (1993-)Marco Aromatario	0|0|0|0|0|0

The author of LotR clearly intended it to be a single book, and it was sold as one concurrently with the three-volume editions as soon as it became popular enough to be economically feasible.  The utilitarian separation of the book into three volumes does not seem to me to be sufficient reason to declare it to be three separate books.  This is in stark contrast with Rowling's books, which have been published sequentially, separated by years in between them, and are considered by everyone (including the author and publisher) to be separate books entirely.  I agree that the individual books deserve a place on this list inasmuch as they merit one, and that the series as a whole belongs on the series page.  I hope we can put this matter to rest now.  Thank you for your time.	0|0|0|0|0|0

"The books of Maccabees and the Gospels refer to the land (and nation) as ""Israel"" throughout this period and the term is still used in Acts. The Hasmonean kingdom was certainly not called ""Judaea"" as this ia a Latinized name and the Hasmoneans are prior to the Roman period. Similarly as explained in the article it was only after Herod the Great that the Roman expanded the usage of their term ""Judaea"" to include more or less the entire region that Herod had ruled. Maccabees and the NT are the primary sources referring to the land and nation as Israel, for a modern academic publication secondary source, see for example ""King Herod: a persecuted persecutor  a case study in psychohistory and psychobiography"", by Aryeh Kasher & Eliezer Witztum, Walter de Gruyter, 2007 where Herod is clearly referred to as King of Israel and e.g. ""A survey of Israel's history"" by Leon James Wood & David O'Brien, Zondervan, 1986, which refers to the Hasmonean ruling over ""Israel"" or say ""The Holocaust: roots, history, and aftermath"", David Crowe, Westview Press, 2008 which similarly speaks of Hasmonean ""Israel"".

Warning templates on other's reverts Sorry about that, but I find many editors revert without warning the perp.  What leads to me leaving a message on another editor's revert is when we both do the same revert but the other editor hits return a second or two before I do.  Since I'm already on the History page, I look to see if a warning was added.  I generally try to wait a bit before Saving the warning, but, as I say, a lot of warnings would not be left if I just assumed reverting editors were going to leave one.Incidentally, I sometimes get edit conflicts on a perp's Talk page from an editor warning on a different instance of vandalism (sometimes even to the same page) some of them crank out the garbage edits at an amazing rate.

""I don't see much evidence that this user is constructively engaged in improving this page or basing content on reliable sources."" This is equally as offensive as were the comments of the other editors- nor is the statement even true. You don't see much evidence because my properly sourced submissions are reverted. I ask you or any other editor to show me one misuse of a source. This is a a link to my last edit on the entry. diff  I include it as it was correctly sourced using per-approved sources that had consensus and the changes concerning definitions in the entry were discussed on the talk page and also had consensus..Disruptive edit, not an improvement?

Now I formally ask you to Point out the reference are referring to in your negative posts about me!  This is not a difference of opinion.  It is a fabrication and a personal attack upon my credibility.  Comment on content, not on the contributor. You commented on both! and were not truthful in your comment about the content and sources.  Derogatory comments about other contributors may be removed by any editor.  Instead, you added more of them.In addition, for like the fourth time, this person decides to call me ""a full blown believer and pusher of this conspiracy theory"" which I repeatedly denied.  I took offense.Both other editors received talk messages from me. After you came along, One editor user: Dbrodbeck apologized for his statement..  I appreciate that and accept his apology and will tell him so when unblocked.  The other person user:Brangifer received a call for truce on his talk page but refused to retract his comment.

I called a spade a spade and gave good evidence that I was calling it as it presented itself. I did not comment on his edits, I commented the fact that he did not consider my reference to  articles from the Washington post, San Francisco Chronicle, Associated press, and National archives of the Government of Canada to be reliable sources.  Unbelievably, you seem be echoing his position.  I probably won't post this elsewhere but if you can't show me an example of using a poor source on that page, it is obvious that you have also posted the same fabrication about me in reference to sources.

Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the notability of the subject may be deleted at any time.

You reverted me and gave a reason when I called it external links, I reverted you and gave a reason again. I don't see the dispute. Now, if you read verifiability, self published sources are reliable published sources: At the other end of the reliability scale lie personal websites, weblogs (blogs), bulletin boards, and Usenet posts, which are not acceptable as sources. Rare exceptions may be when a well-known professional person or acknowledged expert in a relevant field has set up a personal website using his or her real name. Even then, we should proceed with caution, because the information has been self-published, which means it has not been subject to any independent form of fact-checking.So if the person who wrote this can be found to be an acknowledged expert in a relevent feild, then it can be a reference. If he has not, then it can not. Simple?	0|0|0|0|0|0

External LinksYou are currently engaged in a revert war over a link that you have not made a single arguement on the talk page to justify or remove. WP:EL does not require the link to contain information not in any other Wikipedia article, but to contain information relevant to the current article that could not be covered in it once it reaches Featured Article status, which CR does. CR provides a more detailed timeline then can ever be provided inside the article, and further that is shown simpyl by the existence of a timeline article. If the information in CR could be included in the article, we would not have a split off article obviously. So I ask you to participate on the talk page and use Wikipedia guidelines and policies to make your arguement as it would be more pursuasive then simply reverting without explanation based on more then personal opinion and feelings. Thank you.	0|0|0|0|0|0

" May 2006 (UTC)As far as I know it has been stated that several ""universes"" do not fit into the actual accepted universe of Wold Newton which integrates with the DC comics universe thanks to Alan Moore. Thus Marvel only corresponds to the universe due to the cross-over connections or with the exception of Steven Rogers and Peter Parker whose worlds do not clash with the DC Universe chronology. As for Star Wars it is speculated that it could be linked to the Wold Newton Universe, only Star Wars takes place in an entirely different future-past element, basically a universe that predates that of the Earth. And Tolkien's universe is also out of context due to the complex mythology that has no links outside of its realm, the same applies to Dungeons & Dragons, World of Warcraft and Warhammer. However the world of faeries is related thanks to King Arthur and Shakespeare as well as C.S. Lewis and Hans Christian Anderson/Brothers Grimm. Harry Potter's world also doesn't tie in to the Wold Newton as far as I have seen. And as for Looney Tunes and Disney the only way they might tie-in is through WHo Framed Roger Rabbit which has as of yet to be linked. Of course this is still a lot of debate as to what fits in and what doesn't, the only reason I added the list was to inform the reader as to why the characters from those ""universes"" or ""worlds"" were not present. Perhaps it could be stated that although they are not ""accepted"" within the universe it is yet to be seen whether or not they are truly acknowledged as being apart from it as a whole.

"So far nobody's reverted me so that gives me hope. Meantime, let me pick your brain on a broader related issue. In recent years, Wikipedia has likely gained in importance as a ""vetting"" tool for employers, clients and others considering doing business with someone. Naturally, the one doing the vetting has the lion's share of responsibility in judging an entry's reliability and supplementing it with other research. That said, do we bear some degree of ethical obligation to researchers to ensure an entry presents, as far as possible, an accurate, well-rounded picture of the subject? In the case of Ms. Caesar, I was concerned that universities or other organizations looking to employ her and/or give her some sort of public platform would come away with the impression that nothing about her merits further scrutiny.

" musings hey fridaywhile blocked the past two days i read through your subpages.   things like /admin etc.  they are great!i'm burning out on this project  editing can be a lot of fun but in the recent past i've received so many hassles from editors following me around and admins interpreting policies liberally in order to block me.   i also saw that i'm not the only one who's been on the receiving end of this.   i've seen it all but its too long to go into here.  i'm not sure if these are new trends or just something i haven't spent the time to look into before.  ""mere editors"" really have little recourse in this.   filing arbitration proved exhausting for me in the past.   it required a huge amount of diff hunting and discussion for what seemed to me was a pretty obvious case of an out-of-line editor.   filing against an admin would, i assume, be much, much worse.   admins seem to behave like inner-city police with their wall of silence.a lot of your comments show that you've noticed the same happenings.  in an ideal world i think you are right  people would behave reasonably...but i am pessimistic that will happen.   i have come to the conclusion that the only solution is to firm up wikis policies.   we need to define what something like ""disruption"" is.   when someone is blocked for a personal attack, the diff should be included.   that a requirement for including evidence is controversial is evidence that it time for change; we've tried the ""trust admins to do what is right"".   it has failed.

It's amazing that this list puts the United States last, even though it has most of the people and 1/3 of the area. Is someone trying to ""de-emphasize"" America's importance?  No it's just in alphabetical order.   Talk about... Any info in this article about the use of the term as if it meant exclusively Canada and the United States??  Yes: in the 'Human geography' section, namely the 3rd paragraph.  Other related terms are also treated in that sxn.   | talk |  Central Americans are not North Americans! We are own people and we are not Northerners.  We are seperate from them and are nothing like them! You can try to correct me, but the people who say that we are North Americans are White folk who try to keep us down (and sometimes other ignorant groups of people).  I will never surrender to being North American and nor should any other Central American should ever buy into this.  I don't care what the White man tells us.  They're not us.  We should be able to decide for ourselves who we are and no else should tell us who to be.  This is just another way of bringing us down.  I am proud of being Central American and being someone who inhabited this land long before the White people made contact with us.  If we have been living here for the longest time, should it not be us who decides who we want to be? -Tito A. MartĩnezThis is a lovely essay, but unfortunately you cannot undeclare yourself a north american any more easily than you can underclare yourself an earthling.  Central America happens to be located in North America, so Central Americans are North Americans - it's a geographical thing, not a cultural thing. Perhaps you're thinking of Latin America and Anglo America?  Actually, Tito can ""undeclare himself"". If you'll check the Spanish Wikipedia articles on Central America and North America, you will see that Spanish language defines North America's southern-most country as Mexico. :es:Norteamérica redirects to es:América del Norte, which lists the lists the following political units in north to south order:GreenlandCanadaUnited StatesMexicoNote that Central America is not on this list!WilyD is also right, as far as English language goes. ""North America"" includes Mexico and Central America. I think America (terminology) should provide a better explanation than it currently does. A section on English vs. Spanish terminology would help. (I don't speak Spanish, but I studied French in high school and can sometimes puzzle out the meaning. Maybe I'll recruit some bilingual Wikipedians to help me write this. -)  Okay, but I'll claim the fatal flaw here is this:  América del Norte is a spanish term that is different from the english term North America.  Tito may not be a norteamericano - (although I don't think he declares himself here either - doesn't spanish have an equivilent to L'academie?) - but he's still north american.  Actually, I don't think ""North American"" is an identity that applies to Latin Americans. His country (if it's in Central America) is a part of the North American continent, but the cultural division is what he's concerned about. Want to help me update America (terminology)?  I think America (terminology) reflects correct english usage.  Maybe Use of the word American is a better place to move these kind of complaints (although I'm actively involved in that article, and know it'll get shot down as original research).  Roughly speaking, there aren't political continents - Wikipedia has articles on Anglo America (not that I'm convinced the term exists) in contrast	0|0|0|0|0|0

", 15 May 2008 (UTC)Prince Felix of Schwarzenburg is at the right location. His uncle, and then his cousin, was the Fürst while Felix's position all of his life was that of a Prinz (this distinction is tougher for families where all used Fürst, like Wrede, and also titles like Herzog and Graf but it is easily determined). I am as certain as you are about Alfred III because you moved him to the numeral and the only royalty who used numerals, other than the Heinrichs Reuss, were the heads of houses and families. Friedrich Johannes Jacob Celestin von Schwarzenberg has the wrong nobiliary particle anyway, he was zu, not von. He was also a junior prince because he had an older brother who outlived him who was also ""the"" Prince (John Adolph II). I don't mind leaving the German ""von"" or ""zu"" for princes of territories if the title isn't used. For instance, Felix zu Schwarzenburg and Prince Felix of Schwarzenburg would both be acceptable but not a mixture. Adolph von Auersperg had an older brother who died after him but a source I have gives Adolph's title as Fürst, which wouldn't make sense. I would leave him be for now and ask on his page if he was head of the house. Prince Karl of Auersperg is actually the brother in question so logic would mean that he was the Fürst but again, I would ask on the page. Charles 17:04"	0|0|0|0|0|0
True, I've been off-topic. But I insist that, by logic, protestors who perceive China as a dictatorship is not the equlivalent, or represent, anti-dictatorial protestors (I've never even heard of such a thing - sounds more like political framing). Would those who protest the perceived dictatorship in Saudi Arabia go on to protest against China? Rarely. Anti-dictatorial is not a single classification - it should not even be a classification, in my opinion. I would suggest a more lengthy wording - e.g. supporters who call for more individual freedom in China.	0|0|0|0|0|0

If the phenomenon is bad, then what caused the phenomenon is also bad. I.e if murder is bad, so is the murderer. Nobody I've ever heard from said that the stagflation of the 70's was good and the stagflation of the 70's was mostl;y caused be federal Reserve policies.Deflation is much maligned by Federal Reserve through its control of th economic profession. The US did much better economically in the 1800's under deflation then after 1913 and the Feds inflation. The reason that the Fed pushes inflation is that it provides a shelter from criticism of its theft of property through the wealth transfer effect of inflation. The one doing the money printing (inflating) will always defend the process because it makes him rich.71.174.141.4	0|0|0|0|0|0
"Speedy deletion of Vanilla (French band) A tag has been placed on Vanilla (French band) requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia.

" Recap I decided to withhold further comment until I had some sleep and time to critique the logic behind your deletion decision. I am delaying a trip this morning so that I can provide you with a response to your statement supporting deletion.Your supporting statement for deletion is as follows: ""The result was Delete. The deletion argument was that this is original research when the article title is used to describe an algorithm, and that the references do not support the notability of the subject. Despite the verbose nature of the opposing comment, these arguments were not clearly refuted. The use of socks to give the appearance of greater support is also extremely problematic, and I have counted those opinions as being from User:Julie Dancer. Kevin (talk) ""As for ""The deletion argument was that this is original research when the article title is used to describe an algorithm..."" In reality the article title names a type of classification which arranges attributes in order of their significance.  Within the deletion discussion itself the calim is made by  at  that other algorithms exist, namely Examples of relevant works are ""A Fast, Bottom-Up Decision Tree Pruning Algorithm with Near-Optimal Generalization"" and ""An Efficient Algorithm For Optimal Pruning Of Decision Trees"". which are capable of performing the function the article title names:If this is accurate then the right way to handle a necessary correction would be to add these algorithms to the article instead of nominating the article for deletion.In anticipation of these other algorithms being added I immediately changed the body of the text to read ""The algorithm used for this purpose..."" to ""One algorithm used for this purpose..."" Since I do not now have access to the article's history as the result of your deletion I can not give you the exact date and time. However, it was prior to the end of the deletion discussion. (Incidentally, it has been suggested by a Professor at Cornell that deleting the article was for the purpose of eliminating the article history.)Normally as a Wikipedia user I would expect other users who have an issue with such wording to correct it themselves as this is one reason the Wikipedia was setup this way. The Wikipedia still claims to be ""...the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit.""  The impression I have now is that while there were an abundance of editors in the beginning who edited articles that there is now an abundance of spoiled children who expect articles to be perfect from the beginning or for someone else to edit them. They simply do not understand that each article is considered to be a work in progress and the Wikipedia being an opportunity to learn how to write and to edit rather than being completed. Instead of doing any work themselves they find it much easier to go around deleting articles which remain incomplete or have not yet reached a state of perfection, especially a maintenance edit like adding an inline reference that would require them to do any real work themselves. As for ""...references not supporting the notability of the subject"" You can not logically make this statement without reading the reference or references first and you certainly can not follow this with a statement like ""Despite the verbose nature of the opposing comment, these arguments were not clearly refuted."" All of the arguments supporting deletion are clearly refuted in the text of the primary reference to which I deferred. Just as you saying that a stop light was green in a court of law when you did not look at the light would be a lie so would be claiming the reference did not support notability when you did not read it. I know you did not read the primary reference because all arguments supporting deletion are clearly refuted by the both the primary reference and the references it contains.As for ""The use of socks to give the appearance of greater support is also extremely problematic... This shows you did not read or comprehend the response I made in the deletion discussion or only scanned it. I explained that each of the user names were created so that I could track the use of my own resources better, similar to the need on the part of the Wikipedia to require bots to have their own user name even though several may be owned by the same user. Eventually at least one of my computes will be used to accommodate bots, but currently I am able to meet all of my needs by downloading the Wikipedia and mining it off line.Since the existence of the alternate user names was stated and known by all from the beginning of the deletion discussion there is no w	0|0|0|0|0|0

"Just my thoughts on itI doubt there is a definitive answer that would satisfy everyone, and doubt that it is worth he effort to try to clarify in any great detail.In some cases it is probably appropriate, and actually used just like a surname (in a legitimate but different, broader sense than that used by our surname article, and including patronymics in Iceland or elsewhere) by the person.  That's probably especially true of radio personalities with an on-air name that is actually two given names but sounds like a given name and a last name (I've seen that happen quite often), and that happens with various other stage names and pen names that are derived from given names.  But as a general rule, no. Some like Ann-Margret make it clear by normally using a hyphen. The problem, of course, is that our articles, especially the stubs and sub-stubs, often do not have enough information to make it clear what is going on.  If it is ""Mary Lou""  or something of the sort, common combinations of given names where the second one is much rarer as a surname, especially if it includes the actual surname in the article itself, it should clearly be under M in any category (the redirect which should be there, or a dummy one if needed because otherwise it would be a disambiguation page, could be categorized if the full name were desired in some categories, and when that is done a note on the article page is helpful).  But in between, there is a huge variety that you'll likely get some arguments about no matter how it is done.A bigger problem is people with full names given in the article name yet indexed under just the first given name in all categories, and there are lots of them. Even worse are those Easter egg sortings under some nickname which doesn't even appear in the article's own name.  "	0|0|0|0|0|0

That was me. I struck it late last night (my time) at the end of a big edit but didn't want to start this discussion and then sign off. It shows up the synthesis nicely. Eugene, compared to you I know nothing about this stuff. I came here because it was mentioned at Fringe Theories and it looked interesting. I thought I might learn something. I have a moderate level of interest in the early church. I've read Crossan's Essential Jesus (1989), Historical Jesus (1993) and Jesus: A Revolutionary Biography (1994); Robin Lane Fox's Pagans and Christians (1988) and The Unauthorized Version (1992); Robert Miller's (ed.) The Complete Gospels: Annotated Scholars Version (1994); Funk, Hoover & Jesus Seminar's The Five Gospels (1993); Ian Wilson's Jesus: The Evidence (1984); A.N.Wilson's Jesus (1992); Michael Goulder's A Tale of Two Missions (1994); Robert Eisenman's James the Brother of Jesus (1997); and Elaine Pagels' Gnostic Gospels (can't lay my hands on it for the date). Not very closely, and a long time ago. So my knowledge is general. I am relying on you, and others, for the specialist information that will make this a good article.

When I called this article crap the other day, I was judging it on those criteria. It is not clear and not neutral, so I doubt its veracity - as will anyone with half a mind who reads it.

" NPOV dispute Just so this isn't lost by the two suspiciously tangential talk page sections added just above this one, here is a minor sample of the current NPOV dispute over this article. In my interpretation, the early October version of this article was rewritten with a load of weasle words which downplay criticm of the phrase's usage, and subtly play up the dubious narrative genre. More mention of the possibility that the narrative genre is disinformation is needed. The article should be explicitly clear that labeling an allegation a ""conspiracy theory"" is an attempt at dubiousness through association with the narrative genre. Also, ""generally and ""commonly considered"" in the intro are incomplete and need to be fixed for NPOV. The new version of the article seems to be saying a lot less than the old version, we should go through the diff line by line. Did someone ever justify those massive changes?

" Greeks are indeed White people. Every European native, including all Southern Europeans, are White people, and this is according to pretty much every White Nationalist. What Hasselbach stated is laughable (if he really did say that), since the Nordic National Socialists were in the extreme minority. Hitler himself was far from Nordic!The Nazis indeed made some huge mistakes: the anti-Slavic agenda was what ruined them. But despite this, these days, neo-Nazis generally include people from pretty much every European ethnic group, including Southern Europeans and Slavic people. Presently, the term ""neo-Nazi"" is synonymous with 'White Nationalist"" and doesn't necessarily refer to a belief in the Nazi policies of the 30s and 40s. "	0|0|0|0|0|0

That's the common expression on internet fora for followers of Judaism and citizens of Israel who push for certain issues to be seen their way.The fact of the matter is that Jerusalem is not the internationally recognized capital of Israel. Its status is yet to be determinded in negotiations with a future Palestinian-Arab government of an independent and unoccupied Palestine. The personal opinions of Jews or Israelis who want to depict the situation in a way sympathetic to them, for obvious reasons, cannot dictate the content of an internationally accessible article on wikipedia. This is no propaganda platform and the want to post their minority opinion they should mark it as that.	0|0|0|0|0|0
"Response to the disappearance of Madeleine McCannI reverted your edit because you give partial information, not because of the  wording I prefer. What parts do not make sense? The ones you deleted that says there is a joint working group? Stop saying it is bad English, if it was just that you'd fix it without removing information.""Garcia added that when the PJ is criticized then the British police are also criticized because of their close cooperation"" What you wrote does not make sense and it is a bad summary of the Portuguese article:1-  It is not just close cooperation, it was created a joint working group right from the start with the British police. This is why the British police are also criticized. Just close cooperation they have with the Interpol, the Europol and other police organizations. No working group was created with them. I hope it is clear. 2- Several unfair critics were made to the  methodology used by the Portuguese police. Garcia defends that the number of abductions that results in murder is a decisive factor that determines the different investigation methodologies adopted by Portuguese and British police. Other facts indirectly related to the different methodology:3-Personnel attacks were made to police officers because of the different methodology used referred to as ""forging evidence"": ""He [Gonçalo Amaral] was the victim of personal attacks by the British media which not only questioned his honour as a policeman, but also attacked him as a human being."" 4- Portugal has 9 unsolved cases of missing children under 18 (including Madeleine).In spite of all the resources available and the different methodology, the UK has 124 unsolved cases of missing children under 14, in the last four years.(National Missing Persons Bureau).  It seems that the British  methodology alone was not enough to solve these cases. Besides this:5-The UK has a serious problem with child trafficking  6-A serious problem with African children that just go missing: 5- No criticism was ever made to the lack of results of the investigation of the Control Risks Group, hired by the Mcanns since May. ""The investigation [of the PJ], we've stated all along, has the most likely chance of us finding her"" Something made them change their minds?The use of a different methodology is not only used because there are very few cases where the abducted child dies, Portugal does not have the kind of serious problems with children's abduction and trafficking that the UK has. I hope it was clearly written and the ""parts of it do not make sense"" start to make sense.I am going to revert the edit, you are welcome to correct any ""bad English"", not the information.I am sure my Portuguese is better than yours.

" Dear Just plain Bill  Please explain why you could ignore the fact that User:Michael Bednarek couldn't have answered at all and, moreover, revert as if you were User:Michael Bednarek and User:Spinningspark. Please explain why you cannot wait and see for a while(only 72 hours, as mentioned above).  Apparently your vandalism reverts have no reasonable reason as well as Bednarek's and Spinningspark's, because you, Spinningspark, and Bednarek have left the 1)lead 2)unsourced, that looks like evil vandalism and cruel personal attack with bald-faced lies. Please explain why you could ignore your obvious contradictions(lies). Please explain why you can think that disambiguation pages without necessary important lead can be helpful as an encyclopedia(WP:5P). Please explain why you can think that disambiguation pages without necessary important lead can be written from a neutral point of view(WP:5P) and why you have tried to force us stop kind and quick-witted human beings with common sense. (It seemed that , , and User:Spinningspark are cruel Nazis, or facists, unfortunately.)  The third pillar of WP:5P says, ""Wikipedia is free content that anyone can edit, use, modify, and distribute"". This means that Wikipedias are not even admins' private websites and that to revert other editors' distributions unreasonably is not helpful and not preferable at all. Please explain why you can have been doing the contrary. The forth pillar of WP:5P says, ""Editors should interact with each other in a respectful and civil manner"". Please explain why you can have been doing the opposite. The fifth pillar of WP:5P says, ""Wikipedia does not have firm rules"". Please explain why you can have been saying and doing the contrary. Please explain why you can ignore all of WP:5P? Please explain why you can delete the most important lead which explains from its original meanings. The important lead that you deleted unreasonably is below: ""Harmonic is originally an adjective relating to the combination of musical notes to create chords, later, becomes a noun meaning a soft high note played on a stringed instrument by not pressing the string all the way down"".  Please explain why you can leave the unsourced OR sentence while unfairly accusing me of ""unsourced OR"". The OR lead you have left is below: ""usually refers to the frequency components of a time-varying signa"".   Please explain why you can express(lie) ""restore"", though in fact you ""ruin""ed the lead apparently.  Please explain why you didn't edit positively at all when you are not satisfied with others' edits.  Please explain why you cannot think your unreasonable deletings are obviously useless and harmful vandalism against other editors and readers. Please explain why you cannot be responsible at all for the  tag""For other uses, see Harmonic (disambiguation)"" in the article page ""Harmonic"". If you can explain these fifteen questions at once(within 72 hours at the latest), you have proved yourself to be the cruel personal attacker to be banned forever, unfortunately.    "	0|0|0|0|0|0

"In case it has never dawned on any of you - all coats of arms are ""made up"" by someone, somewhere, at some point in time. That is their nature. Their purpose is to serve as identifying symbols of the individuals or families who bear them. Coats of arms do not fall from the heavens ready-made by the hand of the almighty - they have to be created by mortal men for the purposes they are designed for. In some countries the designing of such devices is heavily regulated, in others (such as the United States) it is not. But in either case all the coats of arms in existence are created fabrications made up by someone, somewhere at some point in time and born by their owners as symbols of their iidentity.

" Whole Ariticle Needs to br Rewritten i believe this whole article needs to be rewritten fromntop to bottom.  In jumps around in a chronological sense, thereby notbshowingbin a cohesive way how improvisational theatre has developed.  There is a lot of text devoted to thevwork of Keith Jonstone, but his work is no more important than dozens of other writers; moreover, his importance is no where near as significant in the US as is the work of Spolin, Shepherd, Sills, and Close (and the rolenof IO and The Second City.The article, in it's present form, looks like a hodge-podge of sentences and paragraphs from many authors with no attention paid to consistency.A rewrite would also avoid some duplication.How does one initiate such a process?  Who selects the person to take the first stab at it?  I would propose that Michael Golding of Los Angeles do the rewrite.  He has a masters degree in improvisation from NYU, personally knows many of the people who have created modern improvisational theatre (Shepherd, Sills, Close, Halpern to name a few), and is a professional writer (his latest credit is for writing the film ""David Shepherd: A Lifetime of Improvisational Theatre"").

Providing that you DID use the checkuser, there are 350 computers on the college ground that are exactly the same make, run under the same local network, the same IP address, controlled by the same Admin team, all users can be accessed by each and every computer within that boarding school, and each file directory and drives are shared. In short, the computers run in the exact same manner. Please, from an unbiased point of view, can this be the reason to why the checkuser was fooled?? And if you say No, then you are misinformed or lying, because I am telling you that I did not do this!!!! God, this is getting tedious now.  Also, Seb was aggresive, but was he reprimanded?

The definition for Fundamental Attribution Error that is in quotation marks may be bit too much for people unfamiliar with the terms/psychology that is included in the definition. I would maybe replace words like “attributor” and add examples after both “situational factors” and “dispositional factors”. (i.e., “situational factors such as luck,) Compared to the Fundamental Attribution Error definition that was provided in quotes, the one provided for attribution theory seems more simplistic and easy to follow, though “social perceiver” may have the same problem as “attributor” did like I mentioned above. Maybe for both definitions you could only use bits and pieces of the actual quotation and put the rest in your own words (i.e., change “social perceiver” -> “how an individual would be able to take in information ‘to explain events. Instead of a “in the real world” I would use to ‘one instance of this would be’ in order to have more of an “encyclopedic style”.Using “their” instead of “his/her” before “personality” may be better as well, followed by “in which the individual is interacting” instead of “he/she is acting”. This would go well with the next section where “individual” and “their” is used in the place of “he/she” and “his/her”. Overall, I thought that this was a really interesting article and I think that you did a great job with the explanations and examples. I really like the organization of the article and the content seemed accurate. Aside from the few things that I’ve mentioned, I think that someone unfamiliar with the topic could get a decent grasp of the subject based on the information that you are presenting.	0|0|0|0|0|0

We do present the whole picture of a season here. The question is how much detail is suitable for Wikipedia. Car launches are trivial (do we also want dates of driver announcements, engine deals?) and there is basic information about testing (or will be once someone writes it for this page) so readers will know about the official tests. Remember that previous articles in the days of free testing, the more recent complete ones anyway, do not give any information on private tests, so the editors were cherry-picking information to begin with. Out of interest, what more would you even write for testing, times, no. of laps? We all know they are meaningless, so it will even be somewhat misleading to include that level of detail. As for Stats tables you mentioned above, they were simply a duplication of existing information.	0|0|0|0|0|0

"""NDP-affiliated""I added a fact tag to the four-times-reinserted modifier ""NDP-affiliated"" to the mention of Bill Tieleman; other journalists are not generally singled out by party affiliation/loyalty, nor are publishers such as CanWest (which is widely seen as a propaganda arm of the BC Liberal Party, also one of the party's major financial contributors).  It's not that Tieleman isn't an NDPer, but his credentials go beyond his NDP politicking and he is increasingly a critic of that party, also.  I'm responding partly, also to [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Christy_Clark&action;=historysubmit&diff;=401129881&oldid;=401095803 this edit by ).  I've puzzled long and hard over my own real-world COI on BC political articles, but I see no reason to recuse myself from participation in BC political arti9cles, though generally I give them as wide a berth as possible; but when I recognize POV political activity/wording, as a responsible Wikipedian I can't not say something about it, or challenge the POVism - and COI/spin edits - when I see them.  My interest here is to prevent Wikipedia from being used as part of any campaign p.r. machine (of any party), and to make sure Wikipedia principles are observed - particularly by party operatives who have no reason to respect Wikipedia guidelines or concepts like WP:NPOV.  In the case of this item about BC Rail, there's lots missing, including the search of the Clark-Marrissen home during the opening of the investigation (and that curious telephone call thelling them the police were coming, and why no warrant was needed....vs. all the other highly suspect/irregular warrants to do with that case).  But there's also lots of other commentators, particularly from smalltown papers or independently syndicated, but also notable bloggers/indepednent reserachers like Sean Holman, Laila Yuile and BC Mary who have similarly spoken out about Clark's involvement in the BC Rail matter and how it weights against her in the eyes of the public, and of the ""informed media"".  She may have been out of teh way for the HST fracas, and the Big Media have pronounced her ""clean"" of that - but he Big Media also have maintained a veil of silence over BC Rail.  The current text says that she resigned for family reasons; but it's well-citable  that the timing of her resignation was seen to have to do with the BC Rail affair.  And about the Tieleman thing, unless every time Conservative-affiliated columnists or BC Liberal-affiliated columnists and media outlets are similarly tagged in articles mentioning their opninions and claims (often false), it's not fair to single out Tieleman for this; that's the reason for the cite tag; Tieleman's own byline says only ""Bill Tieleman is one of BC's best known communicators, political commentators and strategists. Bill writes a politics column Tuesdays in 24 Hours newspaper and The Tyee online magazine. Bill has been Communications Director in the B.C. Premier's Office and at the BC Federation of Labour. Bill owns West Star Communications, a consulting firm providing strategy and communication services for labour, business, non-profits and government.""  And frankly, seeing whats going on with the NDP and teh things the Party Council/James supporter types have been calling him, he may not be ""NDP-affiliated"" much longer....  "	0|0|0|0|0|0

"  I've come across variations on draughts, as I've always called it - we had a compendium of games that came in a cube - it had six sides on it, one of which was a checkered board for playing chess and draughts on.With draughts, apart from the traditional version, there were the following variations:Dammspiel - that's what the manual called it - I think it's also called Damenspiel - you set them up a bit like chess, but they were placed one square forward (hard to explain) - the pieces moved almost identical to regular draughts - diagonally, one square - I think the kings could move multiple squares - a bit like the ""Flying Kings"" rule people have mentioned - except that you stop short of capturing - my memory is hazy on the issue.Turkish Checkers - similar set-tup to Dammspiel/Damenspiel - it looks a bit like chess with draughts pieces, the set-up being on the same squares you'd use for draughts - pieces move one square forwards, and, if I remember rigtly, capture diagonally, like standard draughts - the kings, I believe, move like rooks in chess and jump only once in a straight line - again, my memory is hazy regarding the rules.One game not listed in the manual was a game known by one of three names - Arrow Draughts, Dagger Draughts or Kings.Played similar to standard draughts - you play it corner-to-corner and set the pieces up as kings in the shape of an arrow or dagger - you then play it like regular draughts.I have played draughts with at least three opponents - a relative, somebody at school and somebody I once shared a house with - and they were convinced that a single man can't take a king.

"=""color:#4682b4"">Coldplay Expért]] Let's talk This talk page is for discussing the article, not World War II history in general.    Summary of Consequences I believe that in an article one must state the consequences of historical events, and in a summary article, one must summarize the consequences. My edit, stating that ""as a result of the Franco-British action on Czechoslovakia, the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was signed"" is a factual statement. This is not ""Stalin's arguments"" this is not a ""Soviet Apologist stance"" this is a direct and undeniable consequence of said event. In the Spanish Civil War the Red Army fought side by side with the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. Prior to the Franco-British assisted Nazi Sudetenland Grab, relations between Nazi Germany and Soviet Union were icy. When the Nazis were declaring war on Czechoslovakia, the USSR was hard at work putting together an anti-Nazi coalition. Only after seeing the British and French backed down in the face of naked anti-Slavic aggression, did the Soviets begin to look for other allies. There is no mass conspiracy here, as the search began right after the event. This is not a motive, it's a statement of facts. If there are no more objections, I will reinsert the statement into the article, as it is merely cause and effect.   Respectfully disagree. The statement ""as a result of the Franco-British action on Czechoslovakia, the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was signed"" pretends to describe a casual linkage, although in actuality, the linkage was not so obvious, and the scholars' opinion on that vary dramatically. One school thinks that the only and sincere Soviet Union's desire was to establish a collective security system and an anti-Hitler's coalition. Another school believes that the only Stalin's aim was the alliance with Hitler. The third version (the most reasonable, in my opinion) is that the USSR was almost equally suspicious and hostile towards most European powers (that was, at least partially, justified), and considered all possibilities to avoid a direct war against Germany with other major powers playing a role of neutral observers (and, to expand its territory). The statement you tried to introduce into the article is a POV of the leftist part of the first group scholars. We cannot present it here as a sole interpretation of the events. We have either to tell a full story (that is impossible because of space limitations) or to abstain from any interpretations.Interestingly, your statement may be even simply incorrect, because, according to my sources, Hitler's occupation of Czechoslovakia lead to rapprochement between the USSR, UK and France, and could lead to signing of Anti-Hitler triple alliance. In only a month after occupation of Czechoslovakia these three powers started consultations that lead to full scale political and military talks. Had Chamberlain and Stalin have a little bit less prejudice against each other, and had Ribbentrop been little bit less active, WWII could be prevented.Re: ""This is not a motive, it's a statement of facts."" No. All these facts had already been in the article before your edits. Your wording looks like a description of motives, not statement of facts.If you still disagree, try to propose another wording that takes into account all what I wrote. In addition, a consensus exists among those who edit this article that all significant changes are being discussed on the talk page before they are introduced into the article. Try to follow this unwritten rule. That saves a lot of time and efforts.  As there are multiple different interpretations of most key events of World War II and Wikipedia's guidelines require that all non-fringe views be given equal weight, it isn't feasible for this high-level article to discuss casual links between events.   What Nick said, also the USSR wanting to be neutral argument falls apart, because historical evidence clearly shows that had France honored its alliance with Czechoslovakia, USSR would have intervened as well. USSR secured a passage from Romania in order to assist Czechoslovakia. USSR placed all of its divisions west of the Urals on High Alert. After the seizure of Czechoslovakia, the USSR held the UK partially responsible, and frankly did not trust them, or the French, as allies. If France failed to uphold their defensive treaty with Czechoslovakia, why would a defensive treaty with USSR	0|0|0|0|0|0

" A problem with ""English Patriot Man"" and his sockpuppets Hi. Lately I've seen you blocking some sockpuppets of a user named: ""English Patriot Man"". I see that this man is nearly obsessed with Polish people. He seems to spread his anti-Polish propaganda by distorting the historical truth concerning World War II, nazism in Europe and racism against Poles. He is totally denying the sufferings of the Polish nation. Thank you so much for taking care of him, and taking care of the articles that are his main targets. However, now he might create another sock and log in from some other computer or place, so that his personal data and IP address would be totally different. This is why I suggest us to patrol the articles that are his main targets like: Racism in Poland  Racial policy of Nazi Germany War crimes in occupied Poland during World War II Nazi crimes against the Polish nation Invasion of Poland Collaboration with the Axis Powers during World War II Nazism and race Untermensch Master race White supremacy Racial hygiene Nuremberg Laws Aryan race Aryanization Aryan paragraph Honorary Aryan White nationalism Holocaust victims Racial_segregation Nazi Germany Persecution of black people in Nazi Germany Occupation of Poland (1939–45) Polish decrees Kidnapping of children by Nazi Germany Forced labour under German rule during World War II Extermination through labor Anti-Polish sentiment Anti-Slavic sentiment Polish question Polish joke Ahnenpass Anschluss Lebensraum Rassenschande Adolf Hitler Nazism Racism Scientific racism Themes in Nazi propaganda Germanisation Reverse racism Relations between Nazi Germany and the Arab world Glossary of Nazi GermanyThis guy is using multiple sockpuppet accounts to delete all the information about Poles being percieved as ""subhumans"" or ""non-Aryans"" by the nazis. In fact the only ""Aryan-looking"" Poles that were accepted by Nazi Germany at the time, were kidnapped as children and underwent ""Germanisation"", they were like 0.05% of the whole nation. The rest of the Poles were ""insufficient"" to be a part of the nazi-ruled nation, and were treated only slightly better that the Jews. This guy, he spreads lies all across Wikipedia, therefore I thank you for your quick and effective actions Diannaa. If you'd need any kind of help in restoring the data which ""English Patriot Man"" destroyed, just tell me. I will also try to patrol the articles about Poles.   "	0|0|0|0|0|0
Sir: My meager edits were factual, direct authors' quotes and in context. Doc's edits were and remain out of context and reflect that he never read the articles he is mentioning, which puts the procedure in a negative light. I am sorry to ask but have you read the information to see the actual facts? Vandalism by the Wiki definition speaks to the repetitive introduction of inaccurate information for no constructive purpose. Please review my posts and show me what was inaccurate or out of context.

You need to stop making this personal and focus on the published facts, otherwise Wiki as a resource is doomed.

" Good policy suggestion on class assignments. My sympathies about your encountering a class assignment that has gone badly awry. I think your  looks like a good idea, and I support it. It's especially regrettable that we are not receiving more well sourced, thoughtful edits to psychology articles here, as most of those articles badly need better sourcing and more coherent editing to represent current established knowledge from a neutral point of view. Keep up the good work.   (talk, )  An appology is in order Dear Colin,I am not sure if you will have the chance to read this, or if you'll have a moment to respond, but I am a student in the University of Toronto and specifically one of the 1700 psychology students mentioned in the article.  However before I go any further, may I express my most sincere and deepest appologies to you and everyone involved. I will not try to make excuses for my actions, nor will I try to do so for my fellow students as I do not speek for them. I realise (and no doubt others will too) that what we left behind was unbecoming of a sutdent at U of T.  And most importantly, I realise that we did as future scholars was wrong.I know that you and you colleagues are considering taking extreme measures to ensure the content of Wikipedia stays secure as a responce to our actions. Though I can understand where you are coming from, I do not believe that this will solve any of your problems and will only make things worse in the long-run.  I see this situation as a systemic error on both of our sides, but as a first year student I have very little educational and social clout to enforce my statement. I am asking as both an avid reader of Wikipedia and as a lover of knowledge, please do not black-out our privaleges to use and edit articles.  Let us both use this experience as a steping stone to learn how to go about doing this in a constructive manner benefits Wikipedia and my school.  Looking to make this a better place,CivCodex   Thanks. We have no issues with people who are interested in Wikipedia coming to edit Wikipedia. What seems to be the issue is when we have a large group of students editing Wikipedia not for the love of knowledge but simply for marks. These students do not stay around and seem to plagiarize at a high rate.   (talk · contribs · email) (if I write on your page reply on mine) Have replied on your talk page. °Talk  Proposed new policy  I'd like to advertise this (very draft) proposed new policy: . Comments please. °Talk  I think the central dillema is this: a student could make a poor-quality contribution that harms Wikipedia but then recieve partial or full credit. If the grading rubric was accurate, a student would receive 0 or negative credit. My personal solution has been to engage with professors to try and influence the assignment, increase their Wikipedia knowedge, and improve the grading rubrics themselves. I'm fairly proud of Education Program:Saint Louis University/Signal Transduction (SP13), which I helped write. You might want to ask    There should also be some sort of policy re: how the community reacts to profs and students.  The active community is more likely to be aware of and act on policies, in the first place; and we are often more unkind than necessary, in the second.   I proposed an alternative idea on the assignments talk page - as an example of the sort of implementation that I would hope is compatible with any policy we adopt.  –  +  Barnstars {| style=""border: 1px solid gray; background-color: #fdffe7;""|rowspan=""2"" valign=""middle"" | |rowspan=""2"" ||style=""font-size: x-large; padding: 0; vertical-align: middle; height: 1.1em;"" | '''The Barnstar	0|0|0|0|0|0

I looked at the vandalism page, and I have not vandalized the Big O and Dukes page.Vandalism is any addition, removal, or change of content made in a deliberate attempt to compromise the integrity of Wikipedia. The most common types of vandalism include the addition of obscenities or crude humor, page blanking, or the insertion of nonsense into articles.Any good-faith effort to improve the encyclopedia, even if misguided or ill-considered, is not vandalism. Even harmful edits that are not explicitly made in bad faith are not considered vandalism. For example, adding a personal opinion to an article once is not vandalism — it's just not helpful, and should be removed or restated. Not all vandalism is obvious, nor are all massive or controversial changes vandalism. Careful attention needs to be given to whether changes made are beneficial, detrimental but well intended, or outright vandalism.Committing blatant vandalism violates Wikipedia policy. If you find that another user has vandalized Wikipedia, you should revert the changes and warn the user (see below for specific instructions). Users who vandalize Wikipedia repeatedly, despite warnings to stop, should be reported to Wikipedia:Administrator intervention against vandalism, and administrators may block them.	0|0|0|0|0|0
"As for the change in ""Romanian"" to ""Reich"", yes it is difficult to work out what Caldwell is referring to. It seems this particular mission was a diversion to the synthetic oil plants in W.Germany (not Polesti). RAF Bomber Command used an attack by the 8AF to attack this target.The days loses were as already given. Specifically Spitfire claims were not discussed, so the Spitfire's percentage of the kill total is unknown, which is conveyed in the article.More importantly, citations have been given for for the Order of Battle figures. Your lack of understanding of how any historian presents his work work is palpable. OOB are given in lists, as you should know, so your ""give me a quote"" tone is rather silly. Caldwell makes it quit clear that these lists are incomplete with regard to strength returns given. He gives known strength returns. As for Total German day fighter strength, again this estimated by Caldwell (as strength returns for all 6 years are obviously incomplete). He points out, and totally refutes your claim that the bulk of these machines were deployed against the oilfields in September 1944. 1,000 in the defence of central Europe were available for operations at this time, while 1,800 alone were available for combat in the west. German fighter units in Romania in September 1944 were mixed in with Eastern front units by June 1944, making it impossible to tell just how many fighters were operating in the ""oil"" capacity at this time. Even considering that all E.F fighters were at some point deployed in Romania they only reach a combined total of 2,250 compared to a total of 1,800 plus 1,000 for the other two fronts (negating even the Med. Theatre). So your generalisation of a ""quote"", if this indeed is what it is, makes the Bulk of the German fighter force concentrated in Romania false.    "	0|0|0|0|0|0

The Sims 3 expansion  and stuff packs listing together? Since the Good Article review suggested that The Sims 3 expansion packs and stuff packs be on its own listing, my question is this, if we decide to split The Sims 3 games, i.e. core game with expansion and stuff packs, onto one listing, should we remove The Sims 3: Stuff Packs article and merge it into a new article with core / expansion pack / stuff pack article listing? I think the core / expansion pack / stuff pack article is wise, and thus, eliminating the stuff pack article (in my honest opinion) because we don't need two lists of stuff packs.

" Narciso Yepes Please refrain from making edits to subjects you clearly know very little about. Yepes collaborated with Ramirez, not Bernabe, to invent his guitar. Bernabe (an apprentice of Ramirez) later formed his own shop and Yepes subsequently played a Bernabe 10-string. As for your comment about Yepes's hands, this is simply ignorant as to the true reasons why Yepes invented his guitar as well as the technique of playing it (which was NOT to use open basses to simplify technique as some nitwits think - including 10-string guitarists and clueless former students of Yepes). I have the autograph manuscripts to prove that more often than not he used fretted basses rather than open ones even when the open ones were available, depending on what best served the music. Do you have these proofs??? NO. So please stick to what you actually know. (FYI Yepes had extended techniques that enabled him to fret the first string's D together with the low G on the 6th string by using the left hand thumb. Again, we have the proof of this. It was even published in one of his old Scarlatti editions.)  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 129.94.133.166    Your discussion at Narciso Yepes First, you added information that was NOT CORRECT, except for the reason you gave for Yepes's death. And it is not constructive to to add biased, unneutral opinions like Yepes was the most ""notorious""...Second, it is a well-established fact that RAMIREZ and Yepes invented his ten-string guitar. As I said, Bernabe was an apprentice at the Ramirez shop then, but the first Yepes-type ten-string guitar was a RAMIREZ guitar. Moreover, Ramirez had the idea to construct a guitarra d'amor with multiple string resonators INSIDE the body of the guitar. This was rejected by both Segovia and Yepes as impractical. It was Yepes who solved the theoretical and technical problems by adding only 4 strings tuned a very specific way (C, A#, G#, F#) alongside the normal 6 strings. You want a verifiable source? Here: Ramirez III, Jose. 1994. ""The Ten-String Guitar"" in Things About the Guitar. Bold Strummer. pp. 137-141. [ISBN-10: 8487969402]Third, I clearly said Yepes fretted bass notes even when the same bass notes were available as open strings! F# or G# are very often played fretted rather than open! I have this in his own handwriting and own fingering yet you will presume to know better and call this fact ""worthless"" because it disproves your ignorant (unconstructive) remark about Yepes' ""short hands"" being a reason for playing a 10-string guitar. Furthermore, Yepes frequently uses the 7th fretted (because it is the lowest string), but not ""frequently"" the 8th (as you mistakenly claim), which is a minor 7th higher than the 7th string. Moreover, these strings can be used to voice chords as originally written in the urtexts by non-guitarist composers like Ponce or Rodrigo that are impossible on the 6-string (except in the edited versions). Being able to use open strings as ""crutches"" for a lack of technique was certainly NOT part of Yepes's entirely musical reasons for inventing his guitar - though (I will add) many ten-string guitarists today (who are second-rate guitariats in general) have adopted the instrument to make up for weak techniques. This has NOTHING to do with Yepes's own performance practice on his instrument. As someone who has studied for over a decade with one of Yepes's leading (long-term) students, as someone who has thoroughly researched all aspects of the 10-string guitar, as someone who has access to many many unpublished manuscripts and annotations, I can safely say that I know what I am talking about. Yepes even frets A2 and G2# on the 10th string rather than play them on the open A2 and G2# strings (5 and 9) in an example I have in his own handwriting, and the reasons for doing so are in the context entirely MUSICAL and not about any technical limitations, which exist only in your imagination!, you know nothing."	0|0|0|0|0|0

The Liber Pontificalis is not Sacred Scripture, and not I but the source quoted said that the decree attributed to Saint Peter's first successor is probably apocryphal.  Is anything else attributed to Pope Linus?  Or was this the most important thing he did as Pope?  By all means mention that the Liber Pontificalis is said to contain that information.  It was by oversight that I omitted the mention of the Liber Pontificalis, though the fact that I have no way of checking that the Liber Pontificalis contains that statement probably hd some subconscious part in my forgetfulness.The question of women wearing pants came to mind because of the probability that the decree attributed to Pope Linus is aprocryphal. The letter of Pope Nicholas I is certainly genuine.  I should indeed have stated explicitly that traditionalist women are, I think, less likely to go to Mass wearing pants than without a veil, and so the question of pants deserves to be listed among traditionalist practices as much as the question of the veil.  If the pants question disappears from the footnote, I will certainly consider putting it in the body of the article.  By all means add the point that I regrettably forgot to mention: that traditionalists do not like women in pants at Mass.	0|0|0|0|0|0

"Dear Wikinews, Wikipedia  since “conflict of interest” “neutral” is an important subject since “conflict of interest” is being herald by wikinews / wikipedia staff and volunteers, including being used by wikipedia/wikinews administrators and editors with which to have an article /story be deleted, and is grounds for action against a contributor, then please immediately provide documentation that editors, administrators and people providing articles and information to wikipedia and wikinews have no conflict of interest to the articles and stories they create, edit, supervise and/or contribute.  For example, did any editor have sexual relationship with a porn star or purchase movies or magazines of a porn star whose bio is listed on wikipedia?   This is a conflict of interest.   Another example, does any administrator, editor or volunteer of Wikinews and Wikipedia including “BlackPearl14"", “SVTCobra”, “Chris Mann” and “Whoville” own Disney stock, have gone to any Disney theme park, watch Disney movies and/or buy Disney products?   Then “BlackPearl14"", “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” and all of these editors and administrators are in conflict of interest.  Does the people involved with the wikinews articles about fossilized fish found in Canada, or with scientific discoveries or with lawsuits, have any connection to these products, places or businesses?  Then this is a conflict of interest.  What kind of verification did Wikinews and Wikipedia use to determine that volunteers including “BlackPearl14"", “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” don’t sell Disney products and have no business with the Walt Disney Company and their affiliates?    As documented volunteers including “BlackPearl14"", “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” together claim “conflict of interest” and delete any contribution in regards to Pirates of the Caribbean for either wikinews or wikipedia, and control it by upholding double standards.  Thus first we must verify wikinews / wikipedia enforcement of their policy of “conflict of interest” and “neutral”.Wikipedia and Wikinews editors don't follow Wikinews' own written polices... “Do you know of an issue that has been forgotten?”. Then you generate and justify reason after reason to state that the above article is not newsworthy, and that wiki does not write old news. You even say one thing, and then later change that to be different claims to justify deletion.   You keep throwing different claims at an article you have targeted because someone had shown the charges to be untrue.   Wikinews and Wikipedia continues to uphold double standards, and then make statements with which to justify it.  Incredible, you ignore any details provided to your counter your claims, and then accuse the person of not acknowledging your control and your new set of claims.  Are you aware that Wikinews editors and wikipedia are in conflict of interest as well?   They proven that they have a network of supporting friends, using double standards, without following Wikinews and wikipedia's own written polices, and such. Wikinews and wikipedia allows editors “fans” to be bias, controlling whatever they choose to write even placing things like porn stars penis size, (copies of that have been documented as well) and to write articles that are one sided, promotional and links to various sites that further promote their cause, yet the editors delete anything that is added that they don’t approve from other people, and then justify reason after reason, such as claiming other people as being a conflict of interest, not being neutral and such if they write or contribute.  It's against wikinews and wikipedia policies to simple delete ""when in doubt don't delete"" and not to show respect when communicating.  Yet you simply deleted the entire talk and all related pages and justify various statements calling it whatever you want to get your friends to sign off on your control.  If you don’t abide by wikinews and wikipedia’s own written policies, then remove all of the polices and stop tell the public to follow standards which are double standards and more..

Bottom line is, frankly, we're imposing a rational order based on our concepts (separate concepts) of ethnicity, language and government; in some First Nations culture that's a lot harder to do; so the Somena are NOT a First Nations government in the white man's way of thinking, or even in the thinking of the Union of BC Indian Chiefs (which is an organization of whiteman-system band governments and tribal councils created by the Indian Act, the reserve system, and Government Agents et al); but it would be touchy to exclude the Somena from equal status in a template, say, with their neighbours/kin the Quamichan.

"Calling it the white stolen generation doesn't exclude Aboriginals from being recognized, on the contrary it is the other way around. For example when the apology to the stolen generations was made was there any reference to white mothers or children? No there wasn't, only Aboriginals and TSI were recognized. Thus this is why the term ""white"" stolen generation was created to help distinguish it.Even Aboriginals recognize the white stolen generation by the following:After the 2008 Apology to the Stolen Generation, Indigenous leader Max Dulumunmun Harrison, an elder of the Yuin people, helped bring it out last November, when he wrote: “I applaud the Prime Minister’s apology to our mob, but what about the white stolen generation that suffered the same fate? I know many white people who went through the same pain. So why can’t this government do its healing again and apologise to the white stolen generation to bring closure to all this suffering?”["	0|0|0|0|0|0

I do however believe that all of the actions of Mayor McMahon should be displayed good or bad if sourced and that includes his crazy words about supporting Illegal Aliens as was sourced.  George W. Bush, Robert Byrd, etc. have tons of sourced actions both good and bad toward those persons, and the same standard should apply to Tom McMahon. (}	0|0|0|0|0|0

Looks good to me. At the moment, I don't think we need to mention feral cats - I doubt that it is common for feral cats to enter a house via a cat flap. On the whole cats are uncomfortable with entering another's territory, although I imagine it does happen occaisionally, especially if a feral cat learns that there might find food inside. If someone can find a useful reference on the subject we could re-add it. Mind you I did once find a wood pigeon tapping at my girlfriend's cat flap - which seemed particularly unwise.	0|0|0|0|0|0

I had a look at the Sahabiyyeen list on Arabic Wikipedia. There are articles about many more individuals, but most of those are very poorly sourced. But if we go through them properly, I think it will be possible to at least get enough information about notability and minimal biography. But the problem is that my Arabic is very very poor - All I can understand on reading nearly properly is the Qur-An. I tried Google translate as well, but the quality seems to be very poor. But I will try my best to do what I can to improve those articles. I used to work basically on Astronomy-related articles on Malayalam Wiki. I think this can be my major field of work here.I agree with your view that we need more accessible information about all these individuals. But I am not sure whether Wikiipedia would be the right place for that. Perhaps, as you said, an extension...And thanks for all your time. I can understand that you are a busy person but you have been very kind to me and have spent a lot of time discussing with me. I hope I will be able to deal with my co-Wikipedians in such a manner. And I will try my best to take your advice and improve these articles and their sourcing. Perhaps it will help improve my Arabic as well....Thanks again and best wishes	0|0|0|0|0|0

Further, many people with expertise in a specific area quite reasonably make contributions within that area alone.There is, of course, nothing inherently wrong with single-purpose accounts (Wiki discussion policy cautions against personal criticism).If you are going to assume the mantle of editorial arbitor and enforcer, then it is your responsibilty to ensure the article is accurate.

"I have found the original answer in the archives garbage historic, after intervention of Töbel, here it comes: Dear Val, who is also a mormon [or a parrots, 'ain't sure]I found very strange that each time I am answering to one wikipedian/mormons question, it is another who react to it instead of the one to whom it is adress to. I do not see why you are defending stand point who are not at all being made by you, nor why you feel the urge to respond for another one than you. I think that the person concern, Storm Rider, is grown up enough to do so on its own. Unless next time I am under attack, you take the relay and answer that one for me as well. It could be interesting. If you have something to say, say it so, but use your own words idea and language instead of making a copy paste of my entire edit, as you have nothing at all to add to it and in fact seems clearly to don't know what to say. So do the wisest, just shut up! It is in fact evident that you do not have understood one word of what has been sayed, and as you can see, repeating it indefinitely like rot speach, is not going to give you the ability to understand. All you do is agressing agressing personal attacks and agressing. Try to use half as much of your energy to understand what this is about and I am sure that you might see some light. I do not think that my statements can be make clearer than they already are and that your reaction, more than a physical unhability to comprehend, expose your reticence at accepting things you just dont want to accept. You cannot accuse me of talking in circle when you are the one doing so as it can be very clearly seen in your edit. As for you stupid accusation of me not being >sophie, what about you? Are you VAL? or are you rama? or are you DGL626, there is a lot of nick name on wiki, and all of them cover up a real name. They are all a pseudonym, meaning they are anonymous. So if I take the name ""anonymous"" as a pseudo, I will be as hiding and as showing as you are, because at the end, in both case it is a pseudonym with nothing to do with the person real name and identity.So what are you trying to proove, except the fact that you were unable to figure what I just told you on your own? I had a name, this name seems now to be unavailable, and I dont feel to make it again or take another. Following wiki rules all are equal on wiki, old rats as well as newbees (hahaha) and even arb com and board members and admi are as equal as usual wikipedian, thought they have much more power than them and abuse of this power constantly without bad conscience, and have learn to twist and bend all wiki rules behond recognition, so who are you trying to fool with your wiki neutrality and wiki equality, who is wikis first rule? It is all a lie. How can you claim equality with another if you have more power than this other and power on this person and can exclude this person from the group? It isnt equality it is power struggle. It is adversity, and supremacy and group pressure as here. WIKI is oppression and extinction of the freedom of expression, it is so corrupt that not one admi found it disturbing nor strange to banish or revert a user edit to impose his own point of view, on the sacro sankt name of wikis neutrality and equality!HA HA! Make me laught, but dont think you can trick me at believing such lies. Please, in the future, avoid using words that you do not fully understand, as ""logic"". For your knowledge english is one of the easiest language to learn so stop affirming stuff like that gratuitiously, do some research first. I speak 9 languages: English, danish, french, german, norvegian, swedish, occitan, latin, greek, and geek!5 of them fluently, the others as pocket use. Like german I can read a book but I dont have spoken it for some years so it might take me 2 3 weeks to get back the rythm. As a nativ american your knowledge of foreign languages is zero, maybe hightened if you are a mormon who have been on mission outside the US, but you have absolutely no experience of the process of learning new languages. In europe from age 11 we choose between 3 languages: english german and spanish, at age 13, we have to chose another one, and choose between english german, spanish italian russian, from age 15, when we begin graduate school, we have to take another one, and chose between those named before and also chineese and modern american, and a dialect or local language, and can also take hebrew. 2 to 3 languages are part of the compulsory pensum. I also took extra english dialect as the one spoken by semi natives in australia, and english dialect spoken in India. That was for learning	0|0|0|0|0|0

" Free Software / Open Source In many articles you show your intention to use the phrase ""free and open source"". The best way to deal with this is to choose the term used by the developers of the programs in question themselves. If you are working on a page about a program where the developers explicitly use that term I have no objection. If the developers use ""free software"" it is best to use exactly that for that specific program. If the developers of a certain program use only ""open source"" and the license of the program is indeed an open source license (Excluding the GNU GPL. Its text explicitly uses the term ""free software"") then it's ok to use that description. The purpose is that the reader should not understand the word ""free"" to mean ""gratis"" in this case. Unfortunately just using ""free"" alone makes it more likely that people will understand ""gratis"".If you software into that phrase ""free and open source"" something like ""open source and free software"" it would be better.

Thanks for the speedy reply and the links. After mining through about 20 or thirty none seem to indicate a clear consensus on the issue of what is or is not a minor edit. There are some agreement regarding specific examples where the edits being made where disagreed upon such as Template redirects or date delinking but not much outside that clearly agreeing an edit as minor. As I mentioned before I still think that someone needs to establish clearly what is considered a minor edit, perhaps in a table form, that can be added too (or removed) as needed rather than a vague catch all description.For example, after reading the many of the discussions I can see that there does seem to be agreement that removing blank spaces or changes to casing are minor and shouldn't be done alone. Aside from those 2, the rest where argued both ways and it appears that the more technical users won the arguments by force of will and access rights. I'm not trying to beat a dead horse here but I just wanted to point out that the example you gave didn't really emphasize what you were trying to convey and if anything supporterted the opposition if they had bothered to read it.	0|0|0|0|0|0

"************************ HENRIETTA VAN LAER says, No,. it's not that having an agenda at all is a problem for Wikipedia. Wikipedia has a very clear and unconcealable agenda [pro-socialists, liberals, greens and gays, determined to vilify and demonize conservatives]. It is a completely biassed source. Its articles on so-called left-wing parties are blatant whitewash while those on so-called right-wing parties are nothing but vilification, most of it based on flimsy third-hand sources and malicious allegations with no basis in fact. Instead of detailing their policies, Wikipedia provides a compendium of prejudice. The frequent denials that you have a point of view or that you are biassed are not at all convincing, particularly since the whole slant is maintained by a policy of rigorous censorship.POV in Wiki-speak = different POV to us, the Wiki-police. I also get the impression that Wikipeople are pretty young. There is no sign of maturity or experience of the real world in their political views.Under ""conservative"" we find the definition that these parties are merely in favour of the rich. How naive can you get? I don't know what the term ""fat cat"" means in the USA but here in Britain it has a very specific meaning i.e. the people employed in the public sector who get salaries of 10-15 times the average. Naturally they are inclined to vote Labour and can also legally donate large sums to that party. Then there are a million more people employed in useless quangos which would be abolished by a right-wing tax-cutting party. Many of them earn two or three times the average wage, and like the fat  cats, they get generous pension-packages too. Added to the votes of the millions of people who live long-term on state benefits, this amounts to a huge vested interest in the socialist programme on the part of people who are neither honest-Joe workers or low-paid. But Wikipedia is still living in a world of student politics, with a poster of Che Guevara on the wall, his hair streaming in the wind."	0|0|0|0|0|0

If they change the name of their republic, will you satisfy? what about next? will you ask them to call themselves ""Arani"" and start to speak ""Aranian"" language! which does not exist! Ok let's think Azerbaijanis r not Turk, so what they r? Azeri? Ok, let's call them Azeri, what is the next step? You will ask them to forget to speak in Turkish language and start to speak Persian? Or not, speak Azeri lang.? So what is Azeri lang.? where is it? Can you learn it to about 32 million people? let's thing pragmatic as well as rational. Even if your theory of roots of this people is correct historically, you cant ask them to speak neither a lang. of 1000 years ago nor Persian.Also I dont rely neither to researches of Kasravi nor Zehtabi cos both were under some believes of their backgrounds and governments. One was Paniranist other was Panturkist. Some of their researches looks really funny!About the names of Turkish places and cities, I guess you have never ever travell to Azerbaijan. If you were here, you'll see that Iranian government has changed the names during Pahlavi era! Some of them are such a funny thing that r jokes between us. for example Tabriz has a suburb in Western part of the city called ""Akhmagaya"" which in Turkish means the rock which falling down and it is a rocky place, do u know what is its official name? ""Ahmagiyyeh!"" the lands of stupid people! All of the Turkish names tried to change to a Persian words which looks verbally simmilar them! The fact is Persian never have been to Azerbaijan. Most of the Azerbaijani names have Armenian or Tat roots not Persian. My believe is that a mixture of differnet natios like Tats, Armenians, and other caucasian tribes lived here and then Turkish tribes of western branch have migrated to this land in large size and get married with the native people and has made the new nation which called Azerbaijani Turks nowadays. They have their own culture, music, dance, cuisine etc. which seperate them form Persians and interestingly this culture is like culture of Turks of Anatolia which believes that they r 100 percent Turk! I told you history is not important than today, the important thing is every one here feel themselves as a Turk. I dont know what they want us to feel in Tehran!The name of Azar abade gan looks wrong as well. This word cant change to Azarbaijan during history. I guess the word was ""Azar pay gan"" (maybe) which zoroastrian Persians called, not Azar abad gan which Ferdowsi mentioned in Shahnameh and everyone got to accept it now!I had a look to your files about vote frauding which I still believe is correct as well. The diagrams of those .pdf pages show that people of Iran will give their votes to Ahmadinezhad when that company asked them before election, but you know there is unwrittenable rules in Iran which every one know. Whenever some one come and ask me in person that ""do u like Islamic republic, Ali khameni and bla bla bla"" I will answer ""YES""! cos I dont want to lose my life! We dont have life guaranty	0|0|0|0|0|0
Approximately 1/2 the article is factually incorrect, etcon an don in the article are factually inaccurate statements about the confederate flag, esp as underlying all those statements are a fundamental and flawedunderstanding entirely of slavery in the US South.... e.g. 99 % of white families in the US South never ever owned any slaves ever so imputing slavery as thebasis for fighting in the Civil war and so too the battle flag, the confederate flag, has that fundamental flawed distorted view ... Add to that that northernerswere almost 100 % the ship owners and ship captains that brought all slaves over to the US South ; and add to that , that black kings, chiefs were the oneswho sold into slavery, all the slaves that were in the US South... and so on and on the story is one of fundamental distortion... And of the % of whites in South who owned slaves, they have all been dead 150 years... further add to the fact that for 100 % of white Southerners, the flaghas always represented Valor in battle of the 600,000 approximately white southerners who died in the war... Add to that the war began due to invasion by Northand the 100 % felt view of white southerners that states rights then was the main issue and to a very small view , slavery way below that esp as those 99 %of confederate soldiers and their families did not own and had never owned slaves....TO distort and warp all this factual history into black mania about the battle esp of valor, being a rascist symbol further massively distorted e.g. by us mediaas CNN is simply put, mass HYSTERIA with no , almost no foundation in fact .... please add all this to revise the bottom 1/2 of the article which has those endless wrong factual distortions....

Please refrain from making personal comments. You know better than that.  Vaswani being an owner of the Hendon Mob site has nothing whatever to do with your incorrect conclusion-jumping about the site.  You were wrong, and you should have done some research before you made several mistatements.  In contrast, if you would have said a site owned by the person being profiled should be avoided as a reference if possible, you would have made a valid point, and one that is easily dealt with since there are similar sites that could be cited instead.  (Still, your own point makes no sense since there is obviously independent corroboration, and many reliable sources cite it.) But again, that was not the point here.  You should do minimal factual research before making inaccurate assertions about blatantly obvious reliable sources.  You do seem to have moved on from that now, even if you haven't admitted the error, so we can just move on past this.	0|0|0|0|0|0

"I think it is both a Khmer character and a Tamil character, then. The problem with it was not that the character was drawn wrongly, but that it did not represent the sound ""w"" like the other characters in the logo. The Khmer character does not represent ""w"" either.  | talk According to Wikipedia:Wikipedia logos#Alphabets represented in the logo, they do represent the ""letter from that alphabet that most closely resembles the English ""W"" as in ""Wikipedia"".""However, according to Nohat at User talk:Nohat/archive 2005-02-22#Trouble in All the Logos!, ""only some of the symbols were selected to represent ""Wikipedia""— others were chosen at random."" and 2 threads at User talk:Nohat/archive 2007-06-06 say the same thing.

Not very important at all though.    Ah, I (and the person who reported the problem with the Tamil/Khmer character) thought that all the characters should represent ""w"".

Instead, I would suggest changing the title of the acousmatic article to 'acousmatic sound' so that the page can function as a sub-secion of 'acousmatic music'; which is a particular form of electroacoustic music, one which specifically uses acousmatic sound sources. The acousmatic sound article might focus more on Schaefers' and Chions' theories while the acousmatic music page could deal with the artistic practice of using sound in an acousmatic context.

"=Some small communist and fascist groups are definitely cults. Some larger ideological groups may contain a cultic core or special formations organized in a cult-like fashion (according to some accounts, the Third International operatives from various countries in the 1930s were treated virtually as cult zombies by Stalin's cynical bureaucrats). Arguably, Himmler's SS included cultic formations trained at that castle (Wewelsburg?) where they supposedly performed something called the ceremony of the stifling air (possibly this is a street legend). As to North Korea it is definitely a totalitarian state with an intense leader-cult religion (probably the most intense such formation that has ever existedone hesitates to describe it as a Stalin-style personality cult since even Stalin never strove for such a level of quasi-religious worship and regimentation). But I'm not sure the term ""political cult"" is appropriate in reference to North Korea, since the term has been used up until now exclusively to refer to relatively small groups that don't wield state power and that employ elaborate psychological manipulation of their followers as a substitute for the patronage and secret-police power of a post-revolutionary state.Dking (Dennis King), 2 Sept 2006=="	0|0|0|0|0|0

First of all I have told to many pages from the first day, that the account is coming from an office that Giorgos works and that is Giorgos that told me of what is going on here, in relation with the discrimination, personal attacks, enforcement of an anti-Cypriot propaganda, deleting all edits that do not follow this anti-Cypriot propaganda, despite their well sourced evidence, the double standards in blocking, the blocking of anyone that is basically not following a specific anti-Cypriot agenda on the matters of Cyprus, after a war edit by a specific team, the same team that is trying to enforce its own agenda on Cyprus matters and trying to block anyone else from editing (propaganda tactics) e.t.c. Everything has to do with a discrimination, the effort to dictate, personal attacks and the effort to enforce an anti-Cypriot propaganda on Cyprus. Second Giorgos is not writing in Wikipedia anymore, so he has no active account. Third as I see, all the things that Giorgos is saying, are true. You can block the account, and you can block it forever if you please, I will take the matter to the highest levels, and we will speak from there. I will give all the names and all the evidence necessary, and I if I don't see anything happening you will see all the users involved in this in popular newspapers and news-portals, and often, explaining exactly what happened, what is happening and what is going on, with evidence. Evidence matters to the rest of the world, in contrast with here.	0|0|0|0|0|0

"This article is being rewritten at Jack Abramoff/AbramoffRefactor. Please take note of the existing notes and outline, and follow in the spirit of that rewrite/refactor. Comments welcome. Thanks, - Archives  Archive 1 Friday 12th August 2005  Talk:Jack Abramoff/Archive 1 I made some substantial edits to the page and archived the entire earlier talk since it was mostly to do items since dealt with. COPYVIOThis article and it's sister screed are embarrassments to wikipedia.  They're essentially the same and both reflect the authors politocal hatred and zeal.  Both also have severe irredemable copyright problems and are and embarrasment to wikipedia.  They need to be deleted immediately.   Alot of this article DOES seem to be a blatent copyvio.  Tyco, as below, was edited (the text was accurate, but half the news story was pasted in here).  You cannot just wholesale paste in paragraphs of text from a news story, attribute a link, and it not be a copywrite violation.  It's called Plagerism.    Tyco Almost the whole tyco section is a blatent rip from the WAPO article.  I've removed  part of it, as it needs to be re-written. I think I've cleaned much of the CopyVio stuff up, hopefully.  There is alot of non-essential stuff in this article about peripheral people, and not about Abramoff, however.  It needs to be cleaned up more, as the article meanders alot here and there.  I reverted some things you took out (outside the Tyco section), like in the ""Early years"" section and in the intro about DeLay. That material is not copyright infringement because it is properly sourced when directly quoted.  It still needs to be rewritten to not be a direct copy paste unless you are going to quote it.  Just providing a link is not attribution, and copying entire paragraphs out of an article is plagiarism, not 'fair use' unless you are quoting. Also, if you are going to say 'the los angeles times reports' you need to source the times, not a secondary source (i.e. democracy now).I modified the quote and attributed properly. The speech from Tom DeLay is a direct quote (it's in quotations) so of course it is taken word-for-word from the source. I'll tweak the setup to the quote a little better as per your request. Here's the primary source for the other thing.  No problem.  If I see something that is probable CopyVio I tend to chop it out first, and then rework it (I don't usually just leave it out, if the quote is accurate).  Btw have you found a link for the franken quote, I can't find anything other than on blogs.  Honestly I'm not sure what the relevence to an article on Abramoff is, really, anyway. The ""forced abortions"" part was originally reported by Brian Ross at ABC News for 20/20 on March 13, 1998. It also appears in Al Franken's book The Truth (with jokes)'' in the ""Tom DeLay Saipan Sex Tour and Jack Abramoff Casino Getaway"" chapter. Since we've agreed that primary sources are key, i've change the attribution in the article.   The Indian tribes scandal  This area is a mess, I have tried to clean it up a bit and structure it better. It may be best to create a new page on the tribes scam and point the Reed, Norquist etc pages to it.Basically we need fewer facts and more context. At the moment the page is simply a list of transactions that may or may not have been legit with a strong implication that they were not legit. I moved the whole scandal to its own page. This makes much more sense since although Abramoff is a major player in that scandal there are several others who are significant players, in particular Ralph Reed. I am not doing this to hide the scandal, I think that people looking for info on i	0|0|0|0|0|0

Shocked!I am a regular wikipedia user and despite having an EB account find myself using wikipedia increasingly as a source of generally impartial factual information. That opinion took a nosedive today when I came across this 'article' in Wikipedia while looking for information on ear protection. If I want to find out about Bose headphones (or any other product) I will go to their web site - I don't expect to find a companies product range specification in an encyclopedia. One can easily imagine the impact if every company starts using wikipedia as a site to promote their products under the guise of giving facts to the reader. The FACT is I don't care whether this so called article is written from a NPOV or not, whether it's balanced or nor or even whether it is factually correct or not - I DO care that my favourite encyclopedia is being abused under the specious argument that if it's a fact it somehow deserves a place here. I can think of a hundreds of types of completely factual information that I don't want to see cluttering up wikipedia and marketing information is pretty close to the top of the list.	0|0|0|0|0|0

That is baloney.   That statement reflects pure bias.   You can go count the number of rebates on TigerDirect.com and you'll find less there than you find on Amazon or Newegg or any of TigerDirect.com's other competitors.   Regarding the attorney general's complaint, you also have to note that in response to the complaint Tigerdirect argued that it's not true.   If you want to state that a company has used rebates in its marketing and has had public complaints about the fulfillment of those rebates then you can create a blanket statement and apply it to pretty much every computer and CE reseller in the country.What is clear is that a whole bunch of editors have a hard on for TigerDirect.

Oppose all.  I was going to support things until I read Amakuru's statement: we should put the EU second because of its unique position in international relations, and because we should focus on the country with which it's relating.  Meanwhile, we also shouldn't have (country) after Georgia, because this is a situation in which it's unambiguous: US states aren't able to have foreign relations, so the only time when Georgia could have foreign relations was before the United States existed, and there wasn't an EU at that time.  Note that we have many other articles in which the disambiguator isn't present because of the context: List of Governors of Georgia and President of Georgia are undisambiguated because the country has no governor and the state has no president; National Register of Historic Places listings in Georgia is undisambiguated because the US government's historic preservation program doesn't include places in the Caucasus; and Coast Guard of Georgia is undisambiguated because the state doesn't have its own coast guard.	0|0|0|0|0|0

Request to UnblockI began writing the following statement (excepting its two postscripts) before I was blocked. I suspect that User: AuburnPilot had me blocked, in order to prevent me from complaining to administrators about his misconduct. Although I was directed to request an unblock of User: Physicq210, who had blocked me, requesting such of the latter would require that I censor myself, and write as though User: Physicq210 had acted in good faith, and was one of the good guys. That would be surreal, and would give User: Physicq210 a moral legitimacy belied by his actions. And so, the following request for unblocking is directed at any administrator BUT User: Physicq210, but since I’m not a devious sort, I have nothing against the latter reading this. Indeed, I want User: Physicq210 to read it. For if I can be banned from Wikipedia for standing up to censors, then it is vastly preferable to go down fighting, than to go down the long dark road of self-abnegation and self-censorship, including the use of bad English. After all, if I wanted to be a lackey, I could go to graduate school.WIKI Administrators’ Notice Board Incidentshttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentsUser: AuburnPilotA few days ago, User: AuburnPilot began stalking me, checking wherever I had made edits, and going to the articles in question and vandalizing them.

User: AuburnPilot cannot even stand for Wikipedia readers to find out about factual material that upsets his political applecart through footnotes. Zero tolerance!He claims of any source he politically dislikes, that it is either “spam” or a “blog” (or “POV,” another favorite dodge for those at Wikipedia seeking to censor those who fail to conform to their own POV), even though the one source is a previously published, classic magazine article otherwise unavailable on the Web (http://geocities.com/nstix/waronpolice.html), which the author has seen fit to publish on his Web site, and the other source is the longest, most thorough exposé yet published on the Duke rape hoax (http://vdare.com/stix/070113_duke.htm).Note that I am not even talking about censoring writing within articles, since I hadn’t done any writing on the articles in question: Crystal Gail Mangum, Michael Nifong, 2006 Duke University lacrosse team scandal and Racial profiling.I’ve been involved in edit wars before, though I have never been the aggressor, and have never initiated an elective edit war, though given the self-assurance that aggressors such as User: AuburnPilot exude, perhaps I ought to reconsider that position. It seems that aggressors rule here.The reason I am making a formal complaint is that User: AuburnPilot has tonight upped the ante, threatening to have me banned(http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:70.23.199.239&redirect;=no), if I do not surrender to his censorship. Should you find for me, please serve this individual with the wikiquivalent of a cease-and-desist order. Should you, however, find for the censor, please provide an Index of banned publications and a list of official wikicensors.P.S. January 19, 2007 115A EST. Since beginning this complaint, I see that User: AuburnPilot has in fact succeeded at getting a crony, User: Physicq210, to block me, thus not only getting administrative support in censoring me, but preventing me from responding to his thuggery. (And no, I am not going to use cutesy, euphemistic language. If I were into such deception, I would have become a liar, er, lawyer, and would be worthless as an encyclopedist.) And I was unable to e-mail User: Physicq210 because I am not logged in and “You must be logged in and have a valid authenticated e-mail address in your preferences to send e-mail to other users.” (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Emailuser/Physicq210)If this isn’t cyber-Stalinism, I don’t know what is! So, let me get this straight. Stalking and censoring an editor while using the equivalent of smiley faces (User: AuburnPilot’s penchant for saying “Thank you” after vandalizing one’s links) is “civil,” but complaining about such abuse counts as “spam, disruption, incivility, and personal attacks.” If that is verily so, then 2 + 2 = 5.P.P.S The message here says that I was “temporarily blocked from editing Wikipedia as a result of your disruptive edits.” What the heck is that supposed to mean? For restoring footnotes and links that User: AuburnPilot had vandalized? If that constitutes “disruptive edits,” then you’ve utterly given up on honest English and all human decency. Sorry, but I don’t have any sympathy for the Devil.	1|0|0|0|0|0

I forgot to talk about the example of the quarks. That one is only there for spectacle, to dazzle, but it has even less content than the others. That counter intuitive fact only relies on the ignorance on the phenomenon and the fact that the manifestations of the consequences of energy and mass being the same thing are not an everyday experience as oppose to the additivity of mass. It only show that intuition relies on experience. It is the same if I, that have never surfed before, try to surf. I can try to use my intuition all I can and pretend to be a jedi and use the force or the flow but I will not be able to ride a wave. Not until I have passed through the experience a number of times (although I am less hopeful in my case).	0|0|0|0|0|0

"==Notability of Thomas Dworzak== A tag has been placed on Thomas Dworzak requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a real person, organization (band, club, company, etc.), or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. If this is the first page that you have created, then you should read the guide to writing your first article.If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or ""db"" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.For guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria for biographies, for web sites, for bands, or for companies.

I think wikipedia does have an obligation of respect - and we do self-censor quite a bit. We can show self-restraint and respect and yet show the community what they want to see - such as photos of the garments. There are no nude or semi-nude photos on other religious articles, why start here? If a photo needs to be shared, let it be current and without a live model, or at least a model with a face (why are they so ashamed to have their faces in the photos?) eBay and Flickr more have up to date photos, not these from the 80s or 90s. This is completely offensive to the bulk of LDS readers on wikipedia - protecting the page is not the answer to keeping an image on it, rather lets find something that the community can agree on, and this current version it not it, and undoubtedly, as COGDEN stated end up with continuous vandalism of the page. -	0|0|0|0|0|0

Others have been banned. This I know can be sourced so mabye someone can add it, but for some reason, someone vandalized a user page and got me banned so a certain Admin continues to revert my edits stating they are vandalism, and I am simply to lazy to log in to my account.

The marvels and mysteries of cite web Hei, Sorry I didn’t respond earlier. Was through all the material on using  and the time got away. Only had time to run a quick experiment with ‘’cite webb’’ before going out to meet Herr Professor Omberg for breakfast, and then on to do what must be done for the day. But, now that there is time to write, this is what I understand:  Using the cite web template assures one adds a fair bit of relevant information so that the reference is more consistent  And apparently someone amongst our wikipedia friends “rides a robot” to identify new “cite web” templates and makes sure that they go into WebCite to request a permanent archive. Somehow – should the link rot, as it undoubtedly will sooner of later – someone will know how to retrieve the reference from WebCite and repoint the reference so it is still live If this is a correct understanding, then using  is a virtuous thing to do and I will do it.

New Genre The New genre supernatural was used because demons appeared, there were pop ups but ghosts possess just in case, the film was creepy and it was a great '80s movie since The Exorcist (film). What it appears to be that ghosts were especially haunting the hotel, Supernatural is all about ghosts, fantasy, science, spirits, demons, and haunting. That's it, because Supernatural needs to be the new genre in the film.	0|0|0|0|0|0

Potential resources to gain information: Wikipedia_talk:Outlines#Points User talk:Dbachmann#More on OutlinesPossibly, this should be extended to be a discussion of navigation articles within mainspace.  Taking from 's post on dbachmann's talk page, I can see broadening this to include indexes and lists of X topics.  In my opinion, glossaries, timelines, and year articles may be useful for navigation, but they also have the capability to become complete articles used for purposes other than navigation; I don't see outlines, indexes, and Lists of X topics articles as being able to be more than a navigational aid.

Hi GoodDay, I have noted that Qwyrxian has weighed in on the issue. I have learned to appreciate his steady advice on matters and suggest that you ask Qwyrxian about this as well. Regarding the number debate, I don't have strong feelings on this, either way. If you do, the DRN process can do no harm and would be quite useful, IMO. If you want my involvement, I would be pleased to help. I became aware of Joyce Banda through this conflict in the past and have grown to admire her leadership.

"With over 100,000 college students studying abroad every year, there's bound to be all kinds of tall tales, urban legends, and misinformation swirling around.  While there may be grains of truth in some of these stories, below are some common misconceptions about study abroad.Misconception #1: Studying abroad is very expensive.Truth: In most cases, it is actually cheaper to study abroad.  Let's say the tuition at your school is $5,000 per semester and room and board is another $4,000.  Now add in the additional fees you have such as health insurance, books, and laundry.  You are now well over $10,000 for the semester.  Well, all but one of our programs in Spain is under $10,000 per semester and that includes everything except your airfare and spending money.TABMisconception #2: I can't use my financial aid to study abroad.Truth: In almost all cases, your federal aid (Stafford loans, Pell grants, etc.) can be used to study abroad and in some states, you can use your state aid as well.  It is also not uncommon for your federal aid to increase when you study abroad since some of your school scholarships may not transfer.Misconception #3: Host families are all poor and just do it for the money.Truth: The last thing any study abroad company wants to do is have an unhappy student on their program.  The goal is for the students to be happy so that they will tell their friends what a great time they had.  If we were putting students in bad families, in dangerous neighborhoods, then no one would ever recommend us to their friends.  Since the number of universities that endorse our program doubled over the last year, it's a pretty sure bet that students are happy with our choice of families. Misconception #4: I'll be so busy with schoolwork that I won't get time to see the country I'm in.Truth: This one is hysterically funny since your average study abroad student comes home with about 400+ photos from a long list of countries.  Students have plenty of opportunities to travel and we even take our students on trips to give them a better feel for the country they are in.Misconception #5: I might not graduate on time if I go abroad.Truth: If you have already used up all of your elective or general education courses, then it's true that you might need to bulk up on courses before or after you go abroad.  If you plan ahead, however, and leave some electives open to you, then you should be fine.  The clear majority of students who study abroad still graduate in four years, despite being away from their home campus for a semester or two.Misconception #6: Most of the world hates Americans, so I won't be safe.Truth: There's no doubt that there are a lot of people who don't like the American government, but that has nothing to do with the American people.  If you compare the violent crime rate in the United States to that of European, Australian, or Asian countries, you will see that the United States is actually far more dangerous.  There are some areas of South America and Africa that are not especially safe, but there are also many countries on those continents that are incredibly safe.  Go to the U.S. State Department website and check out the crime statistics on the country you are interested in to see how safe it is.Studying abroad is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that every college student should take advantage of.  Before dismissing it due to the bad experience of one friend or rumors you have had heard, speak with your study abroad advisor and get the facts.  I guarantee that once you look at all that studying abroad can offer you, you'll be hopping the first flight abroad.One organization that help ensure that you have safest, unforgettable yet affordable study abroad experience is Academic Studies Abroad.    Here are some of our very popular study abroad programsin the following countries:-Study Abroad Spain- Academic Studies offers study abroad programs in Barcelona, Madrid, Salamanca and Sevilla.  -Study Abroad England- Academic Studies offers study abroad programs in London.  -Study Abroad Italy - Academic Studies offers study abroad programs in Florence.  -Study Abroad France- Academic Studies offer study abroad programs in Aix-en-Provence and Avignon. -[http://www.academicstu	0|0|0|0|0|0

Respectfully Bell's theorem is not empirical evidence, it is not compelling to me and it is disputed as a proof.  I have not seen any compelling evidence that Eisenstein was wrong about his criticism of quantum mechanics.  He did not say it was not an outstanding and extremely successful model, He just said some of the theory behind it can not be correct, the theory is incomplete.  Heisenberg was a cocky Nazi scientist who was badly off in his calculations related to A-Bomb creation, and I don’t know why people wish to believe what they don’t them selves comprehend.  It escapes me and lessens my faith in their judgment.	0|0|0|0|0|0
I've hidden the description of how to pronounce the sound. My reason for doing so is most of all that the character is used in several languages, and I believe it's wrong to assume that the pronounciation is similar in all non-English languages (also when it is similar in some). I'm also convinced that an  article designated for vowel-sounds would be a better place. A link to such an article would surely be the best. -) I do also feel awkward about the notes on being an umlaut and on alphabetization, which I actually feel would fit much better in the articles on the different alphabets.	0|0|0|0|0|0

I think there's little doubt that there is taking in both directions here. More than likely the World Golf Hall of Fame used the Wikipedia article as inspiration for their own text and then an editor came in and copied over a small amount of content from their website. (Unless the earlier Wikipedia article copied from another source, which they later also used.) She was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 2007 and would presumably not have entered their literature prior to that point. But the other content from that passage has been evolving in our article since it was created in 2004:This evolved gradually and naturally into the form it was in when in August 2010 it was sources (probably circularly) to the WGHoF and the snippet of their text pasted in.Meanwhile not all, but some of the content from that edit needs to be cleaned up a bit to comply with WP:Copy-paste. For now, I'll clumsily address it with quotation marks.  (talk)	0|0|0|0|0|0

", 15 November 2014 (UTC)From the Boston Globe:Lieberman, a Democrat who won reelection as an independent, also said he wants to be called an Independent Democrat.A strong backer of the Iraq war, Lieberman was returned to office on Election Day with strong GOP support. He ran as an independent after he lost the Democratic primary in August to Ned Lamont.He said yesterday on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" that he will begin his new term as a Democrat because it would make him part of the congressional leadership. The senator is in line to become chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.""I'm going to caucus with the Democrats both because it's good for my constituents in Connecticut, because I retained my seniority, I become a committee chair, but also I want to continue to work to bring the party back to its historic traditions of strength on national security, foreign policy, and innovation and progress in domestic policy,"" Lieberman said.He said that because voters returned him to Capitol Hill as an independent, ""I am now an Independent Democrat  capital I, capital D. Matter of fact, the secretary of the Senate called my office and asked, 'How do you want to be identified,' and that's it. Independent Democrat,"" the senator said.With many Senate Democrats having campaigned or raised money for Lamont, as the party's nominee, Lieberman acknowledged that it might be ""a little awkward"" for him back in Washington.""They played by the traditional partisan political playbook. And I can't say I enjoyed it, but we're all grown-ups, we've got a job to do, and I'm going to do my best to get that job done,"" Lieberman said.Democrats will hold a 51-49 edge in the Senate, so Lieberman, the Democratic nominee for vice president in 2000, could find himself courted by Republicans.He was asked about the possibility that he might switch caucuses if he became uncomfortable as Democrats sought to enforce party discipline, particularly if the GOP offered to keep him as a committee chairman and respect his seniority.""I'm not ruling it out, but I hope I don't get to that point. And, and I must say, and with all respect to the Republicans who supported me in Connecticut, nobody ever said, 'We're doing this because we, we want you to switch over,' "" he said.""I believe that the American people are considering both major political parties to be in a kind of probation, because they're understandably angry that Washington is dominated too much by partisan political games, and not enough by problem-solving and patriotism, which means put the country and your state first,"" Lieberman said.In 2001, Senator James Jeffords [Addition by Hodgdon's secret garden: (""D."")] of Vermont abandoned the GOP and aligned himself with the Democrats, putting them in control of the evenly divided Senate. The switch made him a hero among Democrats and a traitor among Republicans.Lieberman said Senator Harry Byrd of Virginia listed himself as an Independent Democrat in the late 1970s. Before that, the last senator to use the designation was in the mid-19th century, he said.link  17:36"	0|0|0|0|0|0

(very ok!!!)The less famous villan, but often equally charismatic Ventriloquist, KGBeast, Black Mask and Killer Croc emerged iduring the 1980s.More common criminals, such as the Gotham mob leader Carmine Falcone were also added to the villain lineupThe 1990s were notorious for the introduction of the Joker's assistant, Harley Quinn who appeard exclusivley in the cartoon series.Bane, was the only villain to physically humble Batman. Hush and a new Red Hood are the most famous inductees in the 2000s, due to their connections to Batman's past T-Man put his crap back...

Yes, I agree Wladimir is going to have to many fights to headline now. Vitali has considered fighting Huck after Huck defends his Cruiserweight title and he has also expressed rematching Chisora. He wants to fight Haye but Haye wants to much money to make it happen; clearly he's trying to cash out. That might be it for his career. Since other p4p boxers have more sections, I don't see the issue with adding more for Vitali. But we can decide that in the future after his next fight. For now, there is only the Chisora fight. Given the slap in the pre-fight conference, spitting in Wladimir's face before the fight and brawling with Haye in the post-conference, I think this is worthy of a headline. It's also one of the most defining fights of Vitali's career, as he won it at an old age with only one arm.	0|0|0|0|0|0

"With all respect, I don't know why people only warn against personal attacks by one editor, in a dispute where rules are clearly being broken all around.  I don't think this is the way to make people feel welcome on Wikipedia.  Chussid should not make personal attacks, but other editors should not revert his multiple changes with curt explanations in the edit history.  Any normal person in Chussid's position would find this behavior extremely aggravating and would very likely resort to personal attacks, which is exactly why this kind of behavior is not allowed.   Indeed. And the 'reasons' they give are totally outrageous. These same people DO consider www.truepeace.org which ALSO does not give any names or an address of the person(s) behind it a 'reliable source'. Because it fits in their Zionist thinking pattern. JAZ does not. If you ever wanted to know what Jews who oppose Zionism go through, you are having a nice view of it right now.  ""Incitement to riot is not an excuse for rioting.""

About your GAN on Super Mario Galaxy 2 I noticed that you nominated Super Mario Galaxy 2 as a Good Article. I read the article for a bit and there was an image of the cover of the game, but there is no screenshot of the game as to illustrate the gameplay, graphics or whatever. Good articles must include not only the cover of the game, but a screenshot of the game as well. Some free images are optional to put in the article.

The article is listed in Category:Articles created via the Article Wizard under L.  DEFAULTSORT is a magic word that sorts the page list in a category using the sort key provided.  Because Robert C.

Adding the date parameter put the page in the Category:Unreviewed new articles from December 2009 instead of the undated Category:Unreviewed new articles.

Autzen was not built on a landfill! The landfill was Day Island and is South East of Autzen, see link below. I believe this is incorrect. Day Island Landfill was operating from 1963 to 1974, Autzen was built in 1967. The site can not be built on to this day, as it is not stable for foundations to sit on. https://maps.google.com/?ll=44.049774,-123.056359&spn;=0.005113,0.013078&t;=h&z;=17(71.220.203.185  )	0|0|0|0|0|0

"Let's stop and think about how the Jimbo gif thing has gone since it started and maybe those of you who are voicing that I'm ""stubborn"" could rethink that as an unfair characterization: a admin comes here, tells me that he/she was going to review my block but now won't because the Jimbo animation makes him/her nauseated and that I will never be taken seriously because it's there.  Then, the same admin states after my reply that it's essentially my fault that he/she didn't review the block.  Think about how *you* would react to an attitude like that.  Now, consider the statements made by those who are obviously better at communicating what they really mean: ""it's hard for me to read the page with it there"".  If that had been said in the first place, how would you have reacted to that instead?  I know that if that had been stated to me initially, I would have understood - because it's a reasonable statement and observation, and I don't want people to have problems reading the page - and had no problem removing the Jimbo gif from my page.  Snarkily saying that the Jimbo gif makes one either annoyed or ""nauseated"" and will keep others from taking me seriously, is neither helpful nor clear as to the real issue, is it?    "	0|0|0|0|0|0

"I actually hadn't even seen the current Equalization filter article when I spoke before, but now see that its content needs to be merged into the future article Equalization (audio) that you both have proposed. I could make the issue a little more complicated though: Graphic equalizer (not yet written), Smiley face curve, Parametric equalization, and British EQ all have to do with what I'll call ""Music equalization"" (for lack of a better term). This includes sections 1 and 2 of the current Equalization filter  along with possible future articles tone controls, loudness control (combine with Smiley face), speaker equalization etc. Oh, I'm certainly not saying that these need to be separate articles, but could as well be topics in one article (except that a few of these already exist separately). The article should mention that ""equalization"" is a misnomer (but has become the accepted term) since these are typically used to modify the tone to suit someone's taste, not strictly to compensate for a channel's frequency response.Then there should be an article which discusses actual channel equalization (or some such term) which WOULD include section 3 of Equalization filter (Telecommunications lines), RIAA equalization, FM pre/de-emphasis as well as equalization of non-audio channels; this is the orginal meaning of ""equalization""). Such equalizers are generally non-adjustable (by a user, at least) and transparent to the end user. So I call it a different subject, even when it IS audio. Anyway, I don't have much time to deal with this nor am I the best person to write about the specialized issues regarding either professional audio or channel equalization problems. (Though I'd be very happy to review what is written and check for errors and missing issues. Come to think of it, I don't have to ask for permission ;-)   "	0|0|0|0|0|0
The edit you pointed out as a supposed example of POV-pushing was not POV-pushing at all.  I removed a reference to Steve Stockman running in the Republican primary against John Cornyn.  I removed it because there were two other references to Stockman's primary challenge to Cornyn already in the article.  Also, in the next edit that I did I added a better reference for the primary run.  I was the editor that put the original reference to the primary challenge in the Cornyn article in the first place.  See, if it bald-faced lies like that one that you just wrote here that get in trouble.  You are a POV warrior in the first order.

" The article is mostly about the pound in general (with no mass/force distinction) due its historical treatment as a weight. Perhaps the numerous incarnations of the pound should be in a generic Pound article, and Pound (mass) should be in a similar category to any other unit of mass in a specific system (in this case the Pound (mass) is a member of the ""FPS gravitational"" system of units. There should be a link to the Pound (mass) article from the Pound article of course, but it deserves no better treatment than the lb (of the ""FPS engineering"" system). There is a table of the FPS systems at Pound-force and at Slug (mass) which tabulates various FPS systems. It's a little less clear than it used to be; what was simply called ""FPS engineering"" is now ""Engineering, absolute"", and the ""FPS gravitational"" system of units is apparently clambering for some credibility by calling itself the ""Engineering, gravitational"" system - which of course has no use in engineering due to its offence to Newton's 2nd law. Where did the gravitational system come from? Maybe some reliable sources are in order."	0|0|0|0|0|0

"Edits by KeraunosHi, Keraunos. I see you added to, and rearranged, some of this article. I ameliorated some of your additions for accuracy. Below are listed my ameliorations of your edits and my reasons for them: You added the edit ""because the temperature of the cosmos rising toward infinity as the final singularity of the big crunch is approached will provide a potentially infinite amount of energy to power the cosmic supercomputer.""I take it that what you tried to explain here is the energy resource. But actually, that isn't physically accurate. The universal heat diverging to infinity doesn't provide usable energy. Where the usable energy comes from is the gravitational shear (i.e., the universe's Taublike collapses along different axes with each cycle, called Mixmaster oscillations), which provides a temperature differential across the universe whereby usable energy can be obtained. Hence, I went ahead and cut this edit of yours.If people read further into the body of the article, under the section ""Outline of the physics of the Omega Point Theory,"" some of this is already explained, with references provided for further research (with a number of the references available online for free). You added a bit into here: ""the Omega Point represents the resurrection of the dead followed by an infinite-duration afterlife as an avatar in cyberspace, which could take any imaginable form within the metaverse of the cosmic supercomputer due to its virtual nature.""I kept the ressurection link. I understand from reading your user page that you're into science fiction and transhumanism, but one should avoid loading up this article with needless science fiction terminology and transhumanist terminology, as well as computer terminology which isn't that accurate (such as ""avatar""). The term preceding your edits, ""simulated reality,"" already expresses the ideas you're getting at, and people can follow that hyperlinked text if they're not sure what that means. You added most of this: ""engulfed by artificially intelligent life as it approaches the point of maximum expansion, which, according to Tipler, will occur 'between 5 X 10^16 and 5 X 10^18 years from now (in proper time)'.""One should be more accurate in their terminology, as most people think of Artificial Intelligence (AI) as meaning intelligence via artifically created programs. Yet if uploaded human consciousnesses become a reality, then the programs of their minds would be natural, but on an artificial substrate. Hence, I'm changing this to ""From that point on, the entire visible universe would be engulfed by these 'mind children' as it approaches the point of maximum expansion,"" with ""mind children"" referring to the previously defined mention of the term.I also removed your quote of Tipler's estimation as to when the universe will be engulfed, as that is from his 1994 book The Physics of Immortality, yet later cosmological observations have been able to define the Hubble shift more accurately, which is what that estimation is based on. So Tipler's current estimation is different now. For more on that, see:F. J. Tipler, ""The structure of the world from pure numbers,"" Reports on Progress in Physics, Vol. 68, No. 4 (April 2005), pp. 897-964. See also here. Also released as ""Feynman-Weinberg Quantum Gravity and the Extended Standard Model as a Theory of Everything,"" arXiv:0704.3276, April 24, 2007. You added the section ""Criticism from string theory.""I kept pretty much all of this, while editing it slightly to improve the style and formatting. I changed the section title to ""Implications from string theory,"" since Brian Greene doesn't actually offer any criticism of, or even refer to, Tipler's Omega Point Theory in Greene's book that you referenced.This section, as it stands now, might have to go entirely, as it appears to fall under Wikipedia's rule concerning original research. As it's written, it's a valid deduction that the Omega Point singularity would be obviated if string theory disallows singularities and if string theory is true, but it's an original deduction. You moved the ""See also"" section to underneath the references. You also added a number of links therein.Based upon Wikipedia's ""Featured articles,"" it appears that the preferred location of the ""See also"" section is where it was previously, before the references. Hence, I moved it back. I removed the link ""metaverse,"" because it's a science fiction term that's perfectly explainable with more acce	0|0|0|0|0|0

" The less offensive term of equal clarity and brevity is ""British & Irish Isles"". Believe when I say that the Manx natives have no trouble with this description as they are linked to the U.K. as a protected and supported territory, Republic of Ireland on the other hand is a sovereign nation with no link to the U.K.Did you read the article on wiki about the basis for usage of the term?  Completely flawed logic as it refers to ancient texts etc and precedent for calling them the British isles. Place names reflect current realities, thus we have Istanbul and not Constantinople.  A better example would be the Aegean coast of Turkey and its islands. this whole area was once referred to as the Greek coast and all the islands were Greek islands. since the political landscape has changed and the Turkish state has jurisdiction, the only islands which are now ""Greek islands"" are those within the jurisdiction of Greece. if you were to rebut by saying that British refers to something more than a political term, but rather than an ethnic or geographical one, then the same argument (or even a better one can be made of Greek). the Greek world once referred to an area far greater than modern or ancient Greece (e.g. southern Italy, Sicily, turkey, Armenia etc) and many of the people residing in those parts of turkey which were formerly designated ""Greek"" are ethnically and linguistically Greek but live in the state of turkey, and therefore the islands and coast are Turkish. Thus, you could not refer to the island of Ireland as British."	0|0|0|0|0|0

Title of article in English wikipedia This morning, a wikipedian moved this page to a version including the full Vietnamese diacritics.  I just moved it back to the version without diacritics, for the following reasons: this is the English-language article about Ngo; and the great majority of English text written about Ngo (and other Vietnamese generally) do not include diacritics.  In English, in fact, inclusion of the diacritics is of no effect (at best) or even confusing because they have no effect on pronunciation in standard English orthography.  (Please note I am by no means an English-language bigot: I am a student of the Vietnamese language, and understand the fundamental role diacritic marks fulfill in correctly differentiating phonemes in Vietnamese.  However, it is clear that in English, the diacritics play no role in pronunciation.) The Wikipedia guidelines on naming conventions asserts that the most commonly used spelling in English is the form that should be used. 15:20, Apr 8, 2005 (UTC)	0|0|0|0|0|0

"For the record, Larson was working on a Battlestar Pegasus movie for about 8-9 months when it became apparent that Universal wasn't going to go anywhere with the Galactica franchise. It turned out that Larson did have the rights through some contractual snafu on Universal's part to do anything with Commander Cain and the Pegasus, and his planned film involved the search for an ancient battlestar called the Atlantis, which was built by the 13th Tribe and deliberately left in a secret location with the maps to Earth. The film would have dealt with the search, a major battle with the Cylons, and the recovery and use of the maps to reach Earth, all w/o involving the Galactica or the RTF other than being mentioned.The first article Google shows is this one: . And the Wikipedia set up for BSG had this one: [], although I'm not sure about whether there's some Wikirule about referencing other mini-Wikis. The John Larocque article on the attempt is at: []. Hollywood North Report has a short blurb about the Larson effort, but seeing as how their site has a *LOT* of popups from spammers attempting to load trojans and spyware, I'll quote it here to save your systems:""In the spring of 1999, it was announced that Glen Larson was making plans to bring Galactica to the silver screen.  Impressed with the visual effects and style of the independently financed film Wing Commander, Larson paired with its producer, Todd Moyer, on an estimated $40-50 million film that was to shoot later that year in Luxembourg. The story picked up where the series left off, but followed the exploits of Commander Cain and the battlestar Pegasus (made famous in the original series episode, ""The Living Legend,"" guest starring the late Lloyd Bridges).  In the concept, Commander Cain's search for the lost battlestar Galactica leads him to contemporary Earth, which, according to the story, was settled by humans who arrived here during prehistoric times on the very first battlestar, Atlantis.Special effects were to be handled by Moyer's company, No Prisoners 3DFX, utilizing several of the artists who worked on Wing Commander.  Moyer planned to update some of Galactica's ships, including giving the Vipers the ability to morph into mechanized walkers-à la The Transformers-when on planet surfaces.  Moreover, he and Larson planned to expand the Galactica franchise to include an Imax film, a theme ride, and a new line of merchandise.Then, as quickly as it had been announced, the project vanished from the radar screen.  It has been suggested that Larson and Moyer ultimately found themselves at odds over significant creative issues.  It has also been suggested that the film rights to Battlestar Galactica were still in some dispute.  In either case, the project disappeared into the ethers.""IIRC, Cylon.org had a page on this at one time, but since they revised their site this one and its copies of the concept drawings they had have disappeared.

":Moncrief, do you even know what a shepherd is? I used to work on a cattle ranch, so I know a bit about this stuff. To quote the Wikipedia article on shepherds, ""A shepherd is one who takes care of sheep, usually in flocks in the fields... Unlike farmers, shepherds were often wage earners, being paid to watch the sheep of others."" The 1960s weren't Biblical times. Shepherding had long since become one of those crappy jobs that down-and-out laborers got when they could get it. In fact, that's an important part of Proulx's story, characterizing them as a particular kind of wretched of the earth. Calling them cowboys is yet another example of arrogant coastal ignorance.I am more sensitive to the argument that they only worked on the sheep operation that one summer. Afterwards Ennis worked with cattle and Jack worked most of his life in an office job (not as a ""rodeo cowboy"" to whoever made that remark). However, the bulk of the movie painstakingly details that crucial first summer, the summer that so defined them. Therefore, I'd say that the relevant description, especially in this paragraph discussing THAT SUMMER, would be shepherds. That, however, is more up for debate. I would settle for calling them laborers who got jobs herding sheep. Although anybody who's ever worked on a ranch or knows a damn thing about ranching knows that that's just a circumlocution for shepherd. But since I don't want to make a personal hobby of constantly changing this page, I'll settle for that as a compromise. Chris "	0|0|0|0|0|0
" WP:FILM coordinator Hey, I saw your message concerning the upcoming elections for WP:FILM concerning the project coordinators and that you might be adding more. I'm a bit confused concerning the scope of their responsibilities. Is it largely updating , reviewing articles, and aiding in the establishment of task forces (at least as far as I can see)? Do coordinators generally specialize in various areas (i.e. one handles task forces, others reviewing, or a combination of any such duties)? If so, I was wondering whether I could specialize as a coordinator for featured lists. I rank second in terms of total featured lists made among all Wikipedians, and I have a very good grasp of what is required for FL status. If I was elected, I probably would work towards encouraging featured lists under WP:FILM's scope, and there certainly are a host of lists that could be pushed up to FL status with a coordinated effort. That said, I understand that I'm relatively new to the film project, and that there might be more suitable candidates who are more familiar with the project.

"I've restored the page to the version that's stood for some months. To address the anon's concerns: The revert restoring the ""Criticisms of Prime Ministerial Power"" section repeated, nearly word for word, information already in ""Role and authority"". The revert restoring the ""List of Canadian Prime Ministers"" section created a whole section for one link that duplicated one at the top of the ""Qualifications and selection"" section. The revert restoring the ""Salary"" and ""Privileges"" sections split an earlier merge of the two, for no apparent benefit. It also reinstated trivial and unsourced comparisons of the Prime Minister's salary to ""some of Canada's top corporate executives"" (note weasel words). The revert restoring the ""Living former Prime Ministers"" reinstated trivial information better covered at List of Prime Ministers of Canada The revert restoring the ""Death of the Prime Minister"" reinstated a list of trivia and moved back there information that had been shifted to the ""Privileges"" section.In all, the reverts achieved little, mostly decreasing the quality of the article.

You can't actually put ""and"", as if the two related words had a double denomination, one of which is 'race' (esp. in the modern sense, which the Greeks lacked). φῦλον can also mean a 'class'  as in 'the class of women' or 'the class/species of flies'. φυλή, a more prosaic term, refers to an organized institutional body of men, united by belief in common blood or descent.

" The importance of Khalifman...and of Anand, Ponomariov, Kazimzhinov and Topalov...in being world champions during a time of crisis for FIDE...cannot be overstated.   They represent the rule of law  the functioning of the world title cycle  at a time when it was under direct attack by persons who viewed the title as private property, rather than as a sports title bestowed upon a player by a public cycle (as it had been from 1948 onward).  To say that Fischer, Kasparov or Alekhine were greater players...and therefore of more importance...overlooks this important aspect of Khalifman's title reign.   One could say that Fischer, Kasparov and Alkehine were stronger than Euwe and Smyslov, too...but that doesn't get us anywhere.   We don't rank US presidents by reputation  we list them all equally, yes?

"Ekantik, do you believe that Sathya Sai Baba can miraculously transform his genitals? I would appreciate an answer.I also find it amusing that Ekantik, of all people, is attempting to point out strange beliefs held by Sai Devotees when Ekantik is a Hare Krishna Congregational Member and a Gaudiya Vaishnava who has openly defended his belief that Lord Krishna literally manifested 16,000 seperate human forms, married 16,000 seperate women, copulated with each one of them and generated innumerable offspring. Sanjay also believes that Lord Krishna held an entire mountain aloft on his pinky finger for 7 days and nights and defends scriptures that say the Lord Vishnu (a male) transformed himself into a woman (Mohini Devi). So it appears that Ekantik and Sai Devotees are not really that different as far as strange beliefs and miracle stories are concerned. I can't help to wonder why Ekantik mocks strange beliefs when he holds them himself.Funny how Ekantik and Andries (critics of Sathya Sai Baba) want to promote ""well sourced"" stories about gential switch tales and think the aura reference (written by a doctor in a well known Sri Lankan newspaper) is not ""well sourced"".

List of ice hockey teams in Ontario I updated Template:OHL and Template:Defunct OHL to try to simplify things. Template:OHL contains all teams past and current for the OHL. Template:Defunct OHL contains all past teams from the OMJHL and the OHA Junior A. That template may need to be renamed. Regarding the article List of ice hockey teams in Ontario. How should we handle the defunct teams from the OHL, OMJHL, and OHA Junior A?  That is a really good question.  I would like to add them, as it would allow the list to be both complete, and consistant with the others.  I havent added defunct Jr A teams on any other article, but many of these OHA Jr A teams were the highest level of Junior hockey at the time, I believe, so should be added as being equivalent of Major-Junior.  However, that will likely make this a really long list.  It might make sense to split the article into two: active and defunct  as I did with the baseball lists. I would suggest expanding the defunct teams and seeing how long the article gets, then deciding from there.  If we hope to get it to featured list status, as I would like for all, then we can't use the template as a part of the article itself.	0|0|0|0|0|0

Departments or States? I am confused.Are the Departments of Honduras defined geographically, like the states of Mexico, or the Lands of Germany, or even the states in the United States?When can one Department of Honduras exercise authority over another Department of Honduras?Does the constitution of Honduras subscribe to any theory of jurisdiction when it comes to organizing its departments, and is the jurisdiction of one Department explicitly limited by a specific border or boundary with another?If an individual (or his property) is taken into custody in one Department, is there a hearing before a magistrate (as one would expect in a civil code country) before he (or the thing he has an interest in) is extradited to another Department?I think the main article could be improved by explaining when one Department can exercise jurisdiction over an individual or corporation doing business in the area of a particular Department, and when it is supposed to refrain from exercising that authority.216.99.201.180	0|0|0|0|0|0

Thanks For Your Comment Sorry i have not been in touch for a while. I have been in United Kingdom. Singapore is truly amaing. The People are wonderful they live to serve and they are well trained in respect. Singapore is a different world to Australia and a different world to where I'm in. The last weekhas been full on!!!! I have spent many days in London then head towards Grantham then Stratford-Upon-Avon (Shakespeare's Country)and now in the world#s most Educated city and oldest cities in the world, OXFORD. Lord of the Rings was created here (Not the Movie) but the story trilogy was here. England is sort of similar to Australia, only older, more history, more pubs,more people,tiny parking spaces and so many red double decker buses. I'm doing all right for money and spent some at London's Best Gamesworkshop in Oxford Street. Gamesworkshops are bigger and better in England. I have been to a couple but can't buy much because of space in my ags. Rohan & Saun would love these Gamesworkshops in England. There are Mini Gamesworkshops in Villages smaller than Broadford, and still they are fanstatic. Bigger Gamesworkshops are manily in more bigger Towns and Cities eg Nottingham, London, Mancester, Oxford and many more. Tell Rohan that i went past the Gamesworkshop Headquarters, the Citadel Miniatures Factory and Warhammer World in Nottingham. But Unfortunaly i could not go because we had no time because our destination was Derbyshire and ran out of time. But I certainly will go there when i come back to England if i have time. I'm still a little Jet Laged from the plane journey to London from Singapore. I will be back at Assumption College on Oct 12th i think.CheersTom	0|0|0|0|0|0

False statementA continuous random variable does not always have a density.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 194.4.140.135   DefinitionI dont like the definition here, not that I'm letting my ignorance of stats stop me from commenting, but could this be considered a clearer definition?:""Random VariableThe outcome of an experiment need not be a number, for example, the outcome when a coin is tossed can be 'heads' or 'tails'. However, we often want to represent outcomes as numbers. A random variable is a function that associates a unique numerical value with every outcome of an experiment. The value of the random variable will vary from trial to trial as the experiment is repeated.There are two types of random variable - discrete and continuous.A random variable has either an associated probability distribution (discrete random variable) or probability density function (continuous random variable).I think this is definitely an improvement but it should be pointed out that there exists r.v.'s which are neither discrete nor continuous (for example take the sum of one r.v. of each type) The current definition is bad in that it is neither clear to the lay reader nor specific to the technical reader. The above definition is far better on both counts and so I will put it on the page.   BTW, sorry about the no summary edit, I hit the enter key accidentally.   Examples A coin is tossed ten times. The random variable X is the number of tails that are noted. X can only take the values 0, 1, ..., 10, so X is a discrete random variable. A light bulb is burned until it burns out. The random variable Y is its lifetime in hours. Y can take any positive real value, so Y is a continuous random variable. ""I think the above definition (for the original reference, pls search via google) explains to me that it is a mapping between a value and the sequence number of that value, rather like a numeric index to a database record. This would appear to allow greater generalization in statistical definitions and algorithms. The earler Wikiedia definition led me to comment on another Wikipedia definition incorrectly because I think I may have misunderstood the concept after looking at this Wikipedia definition.A random variable is a function that assigns a numerical value to an event. This example:just assigns another event to an event. Could we change it to something like:Consider a game where if a 6 is rolled on a fair six-sided die, player 1 wins, and otherwise, player 2 wins. Let X represent the number of times player 1 wins. Thenandor maybe include an example of a continuous random variable? What do you think?  This section should begin with a sentence of the form ""A random variable is ..."". To avoid this is to show that you don'	0|0|0|0|0|0

BLP stuffI'm sorry I got annoyed with you. It is a bit tiresome having to deal with some of this stuff, and you probably didn't deserve the full brunt of my frustration there. Still, please be sensitive to this in the future; I have, in fact, been dealing with people harassing me over this, and thus when I see you complaining about it over on ANI, I just see it as more of the same. It isn't much fun, which is why I try to do this stuff only every other day or so with any great amount of focus, spending the rest of my free time writing about ponies kissing or playing video games or working on my own game or doing other stuff. The only reason I'm even still involved with all of this is because I have a much higher tolerance than most people for doing stupid stuff like counting sources or fact-checking or whatever, because I have a high tolerance for abuse because I have an enormous ego, and because I feel that it is important to keep Wikipedia neutral about all things, even stupid internet fights.I'm sorry for missing your question over on GamerGate about my edit.

"Well I might consider and then might even agree with you that perhaps one could point me to WP:DBAD (here spelled in a form of euphemism for my potential benefit -) ), as I consider you had pointed me (  ;-)  ), but that still hasn't given any solutions to the disagreement which goes on the talk page (here I mean the Talk:International recognition of Kosovo page). As far as the WP:RM (if this is what you had in mind) is concerned, my opinion is that the third conversator  thinks other of the procedure (I'm still not sure that there is one). Moreover, I'm certain that for the time being he doesn't think of another POV of the ""procedure"", because of this words of his, which are somehow unclear (at least to me): ""Any new proposals will be speedy closed. Persistence will be dealt with sanctions as per the WP:ARBMAC probation this article is under the scope of."" concerning the closure of ""proposal"". I'm not sure if he meant new proposals through the talk page of International recognition of Kosovo (""IroK"") or through the WP:RM. Actually, I find WP:RM somehow vague on the sequence of steps to be taken when new request/proposal is to be made. I've tried to follow the procedure proposed as it is given at WP:RM, but then I might misunderstood something. I might consider asking for explanation on the very own project's page, as for that matter. Hus, as a formalist as I consider you at the moment, I must ask you now this: when you wrote all controversial move proposals must go through... in order to have any validity you actully wanted to write all controversial move proposals should go through...in order to have any validity. I suppose I pointed out ( one might consider I've used irony, I apologize to those) to the ambiguity of interpretation of the potential procedure, since the very procedure hasn't been tagged as a guideline, but still named a project, to the least. Maybe, some other place exists, which I'm not aware of - I apologize in advance for me being somewhat a whiner, since I've been passive and not searching for potential one myself. Not to mention judgemental and still non-constructive enough, to contribute myself (although recognition of the problem might be considered as form of contiributing action -? -/ ). Sorry for that.Ijanderson977, you asked: Why are you not claiming that this article has a POV title: International recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia? Well, actually, I do consider this title is biased also. But personally I consider the ""IroK"" more globally important, not just to me, as one might think it is. If the bias is dealt with this issue (IroK title), it could be dealt elsewhere also. And IMHO it is good to keep the discussion in one place -> maybe creating a new page, where this discussion concerning the term ""recognition"" (or more) could be taken, should be considered as an idea.All the best.

" September 2013 (UTC)I love how I specifically tried in a polite manner to engage in meaningful dialogue here, and asked you to respond in a way to help me understand why you refuse to accept the submission.  Your 2-line response was the equivalent of ""nana-nana boo-boo,"" as far as I am concerned. Let's dissect these 2 lines.""::you don't understand propaganda.""That is a loaded statement if I ever read one. I have read up on the term propaganda, thanks very much, and my readings are not simply limited to this website, which I feel is narrow in its scope. I have been on a program that toured the death camps of Poland and studied the use of propaganda in Nazi Germany. I am currently awaiting a response from a PhD who has lectured and studied the use of propraganda in the media/industry, and it is with respect to our point of contention here. Funny, I can't find any work you have done on this subject, Mr. Jensen, yet you seem to be trying to claim superior academic grounds here. I have made an attempt to engage in meaningful dialogue, and you response above clearly shows you cannot or will not make an effort to present factual arguments to prove such a comment. ""You use the word to denounce advertising for products you consider harmful.""I am not denouncing advertising for products I consider harmful, and this is what you need to understand, because I have stated this on multiple occasions in many different ways. This statement you have just made is a personal attack. Additionally, it is incorrect. I don't consider the product to be harmful. It is harmful. This is not an opinion, but a restating of facts by the IARC/WHO, and health organizations worldwide, based on the overwhelming body of evidence that is available. If it were simply an opinion, I can understand why you could be frustrated. But the irony, Mr. Jensen, is that the fact that you and others believe that this is simply an opinion is possibly the result of hearing or reading propaganda used by those in the tanning industry to cloud the picture. Tanning bed exposure is strongly associated with skin cancer, among other health risks (please take the time, I urge you, to read any or all of the references I quoted in my submission, all from established medical journals). The industry claims that these risks are not existent or are insignificant, says that UV exposure is more controlled in a tanning bed (not proven whatsoever), and claims health benefits of tanning bed use that are either unproven (e.g. cancer prevention, ""base tan""), exaggerated, and can be achieved through safer means (e.g. Vitamin D exposure). So please enlighten me, Mr Jensen, as to what propaganda is? Is propaganda not ""a form of communication aimed towards influencing the attitude of the community toward some cause or position by presenting only one side of an argument?"". That's the definition on the wiki page, right? I am sure you have head of a systematic review - that is when an established researcher evaluates all of the evidence for and against an exposure, and concludes if the body of evidence favours a hypothesis. It is the most balanced and unbiased way to assess an intervention or exposure. Well, that's what I use, and that's what the World Health Organization used, when they came to an unbiased conclusion that UV exposure from tanning beds (as well as the sun) is a carcinogen, in the same class as cigarettes. In my submission, I think I clearly showed that there are many in the tanning industry and their associated organizations who have reported only the small studies that show their point of view, but neglect to mention the overwhelming amount of evidence that goes against their points, including the systematic reviews I mention. Is this not the same as ""presenting one side of an argument"" to ""influence the attitude of the community""? Or, is it that, as you say, I just ""don't understand propaganda""? I have to say it yet again to you, because I think this is such an important point that I have to drive home - this is not my ""opinion"". 1) Tanning beds cause more harm than good, fact. 2) Tanning industry sites present the good (which is partly true) and negate the bad (partly false), and this is also a fact. If you can find me a tanning industry association that clearly presents a balanced view, you show it to me because this would run counter to the principle of ""good business"" - its impossible for an industry that causes harm to remove a conflict of interest when weighing evidence for or against their product, and the result is advertising that is propaganda. 3) The industry has used scapegoats/diversion tactics (e.g. suggesting that Cancer Society and Neutrogena are connected in an elaborate scheme to sell skin products through fear mongering, stating that the government is taking responsibility away from parents to make decisions on behalf of their children, blaming o	0|0|0|0|0|0

Personally I think many of the disputes could be resolved if we had some consistency in what is and what isn't to be said about politicians, and that is, more than anything, a structural issue with Wikipedia that probably has also been dealt with extensively in other wikis, concerning, perhaps, George Bush.  Perhaps we can should be looking there for guidance as to how the community has dealt with the issue.Basically what we have is one camp who wants to tar Grant Devine/Brad Wall with (sourced and referenced) bad stuff, but goes and eliminates the (sourced and referenced) bad stuff written about Lorne Calvert and other figures in NDP administrations.  And we have another camp that does the opposite, and an edit war is the ultimate result.	0|0|0|0|0|0

"I don't want to ""reopen"" the issue, as the issue was never actually solved. Wikipedia policies are pretty clear on what consititutes a valid source for any topic, and children's books and books not about the specific topic but that happen to mention it as an aside based upon no real knowledge of the topic clearly do not count. Instead of just blind reverting changes, I'd like someone to try to come up with some sort of justification within Wikipedia policies that would make including such weak and nonacademic references as sources. Whenever a source is in question, it should be up to the person who wants them to stay to provide reasons, not to just keep them come hell or high water because of some people's bias against editors who aren't signed in. These changes were badly needed, and seemingly the only reason they were undone was by one editor who thinks he WP:OWNs the article and others who violated WP:AGF and assumed that an anon user must be up to no good.

I think we need to write to Debretts (David Williamson is now dead) to ask if they actually had sight of the Letters Patent otherwise I would find it hard to accept their assertion. It would effectively mean that his eldest daughter had a fundamental right to call herself and be referred to in all legal documents as Baroness or Lady Home of Berwick. But in fact there is not one document - notably her Testament - that I can find that refers to them as such. Merely as his daughters with the honorific 'Lady' because they were daughters of an Earl. In addition, Debretts cannot settle these issues. Did Alec Douglas-Home make a claim in The House for that Peerage to be added to his stable? Because that seems to be what they're saying. Frankly I would treat such a suggestion with disbelief.	0|0|0|0|0|0

I strongly agree with Lneal00 to keep those national statistics out because of completely varying methods used by different stat agencies in different countries. The numbers must come from one organization, claiming A+B = C is synthesis and is a direct violation of WP:OR. However, I agree with Ahecht that there's no problem with the ILO list. It's from the BBC and the ILO list should be in because the numbers are coming from one highly reliable organization, if not the most reliable one, so we are comparing apples to apples, even if there are some flaws in that method. That flaw, as Ahecht suggested, should be mentioned in the methodology. But blanking out such a highly reliable source because of that is unacceptable and a serious violation of WP:NPOV. We can't favor one source over the another.	0|0|0|0|0|0

" basic income dispute resolution I don't understand the finding ""futile"", or how to proceed to resolve the issue.  Regarding the [Wikipedia,_bicycles,_and_wagons] reference, its my understanding that I am building a bicycle, that may be slightly off spec, and the editors are ordering the steel melted and shipped to hell, instead of allowing the bicycle to be refined into spec.  I point out also that the [basic income] is listed as a priority by four wikigroups, and so it is a pretty important bicycle.  Also the nature of basic income is at a theoretical philosophy stage, and the highest quality references possible are available to verify and preferably succinct, and high quality blogs provide the best verifiability, IMO, but regardless of this opinion, a section on proposed benefits does not need prestigious academic references if the claim being made is that the ideas and rationale has merely been proposed.  To keep the bicycles/wagons analogy, the page was a high quality bicycle, and an important bicycle to 4 wikigroups.  There is a difference of opinion over whether the bicycle meets specs, but it is a functional bicycle that is more useful than a pile of melted metal shipped far away.   "	0|0|0|0|0|0

"=== Page is in rough shape ===With the recent purge of content, the page is not as informative as it once was.  The biggest problem is the first section which had the  ""proposed benefits of basic income"" topic removed.  One editor may appear to hate naturalfinance.net, since the reason for removal was declaring that site to be a blog.  Also removed were affordability calculations that were researched and verified with working links, but also published on a platform that can be declared to be a blog.  Meanwhile the content left in the top section has poor references that do not appear to match the content.  For instance there is no reference for any conclusive argument or data that basic income creates a disincentive to work, and the link to reciprocity is not online, and the topic not a major issue.  Both of those topics have good quality ""blog classifiable"" sources available.In order to Be Bold, I would recommend that eligible source material be broadened to include any quality content, including from sources that are not government funded.  Basic income is after all not within any traditional government agenda, and so limiting information to sources funded by interests against basic income harms the quality of the article, and prejudices/suppresses the article from being informative and enlightening.  Barring this broadened content eligibility, we all need guidance for what is eligible content, and perhaps what makes naturalfinance.net ineligible.  (The content there was written in 2011, and has been adopted, whether independently or without attribution, by other authors)Here is the major recent deletion https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Basic_income&diff;=595677190&oldid;=595667344 .  Specifically the proposed benefits section should be reproduced.  Some of these can be sourced elsewhere, but we need a clear understanding of why it was originally deleted:   Proposed Benefitsnaturalfinance.net describes several purported benefits of social dividends and basic income: Wealth redistribution is the best possible economic development program because the wealthy don't spend as great a portion of their income as the poor do. Basic income is the most efficient possible form of wealth redistribution because there is no bureaucratic overhead needed to filter recipients, or find and punish abusers. Basic income as an alternative to public retirement pensions (such as social security in the US) is the only possible prevention of generational theft that will occur if the funding sustainability of future retiree pensions and care is threatened Reduced crime as a result of lower levels of desperation. Balanced power in the labour market as a result of not needing work out of desperation, and better competitive position of workers if some people choose not to work. Better work opportunities as a result of people better able to afford an education or business start up. Smaller government made possible and attractive by the alternative of increased basic income to offset any program cost reduction.  Viewed this way, the cost of every government program is paid for equally by each citizen, even if the source of government revenue is progressive income taxation. Social justice is achieved efficiently and automatically, with less requirement on charity and welfare. It is easier for volunteer home owners to help the poor and secluded through group homes by being able to rely on their certain income.  Its possible and easier for the disadvantaged to group up and help themselves in the same manner. Natural finance's definition of social dividends (variable basic income: tax revenue surplus over social program expenses) essentially allows the level of basic income paid to citizens to rise with economic, productivity, and automation growth. The affordability of basic income adjusts automatically to the performance of the economy."	0|0|0|0|0|0

Yes, I must second this.  Scottsdale is not at all expensive compared to many, many U.S. locales.  Please understand, resort places are never as wealthy as the places from which their residents came.  The average income in Scottsdale is $50k, average house is $400k?  That won't get you into a good suburb in most major urban areas. Scottsdale really resembles a little Las Vegas, sans casinos, i.e. showy surface fanciness.

Mexico a Regional Power? I don't agree that Mexico is a Regional Power at least of Latin America, it could be a Regional Power of Central America, but nowadays it is considered to be part of North America.In the other areas of the world, the article is divided between East, West, North, South not between ethnic or languagegroups. If this was the case in Europe it could be considered, Latin, Germanic, Slave and even Anglo-Saxon groups.If we consider this, in the Americas case it should be South America and not Latin America.Second case, Mexico has a great GDP but in overal terms GDP is not the only factor, we should consider military, power projection and foreign policy. Mexico has a ridiculous military and projection power and politically is a subalternous nation to the USA Argentina, Venezuela or Colombia have greater military and power projection capabilities, historically they have been much more interventionous and agressive toward other nations than Mexico and today we can see the same, specially in Venezuela case. 16:11, 13 May 2007Personally I agree with you, but you need sources to say it. This encyclopedia is not a place for Orignal Research. Furthemore, editors have produced sources saying Mexico is a Regional Power of Latin America, if we change it to South America there would be no place in wich to put Mexico. Besides, Brazil's influence is not restricted to South America, it would not make sense to say it is restricted since the sources don't agree.	0|0|0|0|0|0
Note that in one case the conversion was incorrect before the vandalism, and had been so for a while.

Among others, it quotes John Stauber to the effect that MoveOn has become ""primarily a money-raising and marketing arm of the Pelosi wing of the Democratic Party.""

" 2010 (UTC)An interesting comment:  ""Convict leasing isn't the same as slavery where there's ownership and title. However, I would agree that we could amend the lead to read: ""effectively abolished slavery...""True there is a difference with chattel slavery and forced prison slave labour. One ended w/ the 13th amendment, and the other was legalised under the 13th amendment (not the Corwin Amendment of 1861). In other words, what would be the legal justification for the prison labour in California, Oregon and other states that practise this form of human rights abuse without the ""involuntary servitude"" clause? WWhat do you think they were referring to? Futhermore, I don't see a problem including this in the article, so long as it is a small reference, and not the focus of the article. As to scholarship, there is reputable work on this, and there is no doubt that starting in 1866 the prison chain gangs were leased to private business, plantations, mines etc for being picked up for the most frivilous charges. Yes they were mostly black. The mortality rate was higher than chattel slavery because they were leased and not owned. Virtual life sentences on absurd charges directed against black people w/ forced labour is slavery, though not chattel. This was systematic and went on until WW2, though today's version is slightly different. Now, some of you asked for refrences and rightly so. Slavery by Another Name by Douglas Blackmon, who is a respected writer & journalist and received the Pulitzer Prize for this book which is on this very topic. That's the point. This is FAR from original research, and there are other scholars who've written about it. Now I haven't edited the article nor will I unless there is some agreement w/ others editors here, but I'd like to know the issue as it is now. How do other editors feel? One other thing, American historians do not always agree on things, and I have noticed at least one conspicious neo-Confederate argument in the article (unsourced), though on a different part of the article. So yes it's important to look at historians, but on some topics there's a whole lot of rubbish, particularly w/ slavery issues, so a consensus by historians may never happen, and sadly ideological agendas do exist, and I understand what you blokes mean about good sources. I'd say that keeping this article from vandalism is far more important.  15:00, 18 July"	0|0|0|0|0|0
"The use of the word ""goal"" was merely an approximation I hoped would help the explanation. It's not currently used in the article.

If the perception of intervals was arithmetic instead of geometric, our equal tempered scales would be arithmetic sequences instead. -  "	0|0|0|0|0|0

Centrifugal Force Acroterion, recently you took an interest in the centrifugal force page. I would be most grateful if you could look at the recent deletion of my edit on the main page of that article. If you check it out, you will find that Wolfkeeper has a long record of deleting things which I put on the main article.When I put that edit on yesterday, I was fully expecting Wolfkeeper to delete it. But I was very careful to make sure that the edit contained only basic textbook material and that there could be no possible grounds to justify him deleting it.You will recall that my block last week was because I was accused of incivility by having accused Wolfkeeper of wikistalking for having deleted stuff that had put on the main page.Interestingly, Wolfkeeper has attempted to justify his actions this time. His first reason was pathetic. It was something to do with the section being out of place. The second reason merely exposes Wolfkeeper's total lack of knowledge about the topic in question.The marble experiences a side on Coriolis force as it rolls out to the edge of the turntable. Interestingly, PhySusie who I presume was attempting to back up Wolfkeeper has then come in and stated this very fact as if it were me that didn't know it.If you are genuinely interested in justice on wikipedia and proving that there is no corruption, I would be most grateful if you could monitor the ensuing debate very carefully.I know that you say that you are not trained in this topic but it is all very basic stuff and I am sure that you will be more than capable of seeing exacly what is going on.	0|0|0|0|0|0
"RewiredI see you have updated the security system. Nice. Is it a McAfee 2000?. Just dropped by to relate a little story I uncovered as I wandered here and there...There once was a little boy named Johnny who had a wonderful dog named Laddie.  Johnny was prone to emotional outbursts, and his mother was concerned by his overreactions. One day while Johnny was at school, Laddie was killed in an unfortunate accident. The mother took Laddie's body and put it in the backyard. She was very worried how Johnny would react to the news of his dog's death. When Johnny returned from school, his mother said to him, ""I'm really sorry, Johnny, but Laddie died in an accident."" Johnny responded ""Okay"" and went upstairs to change his clothers. The mother was quite surprised at the calm reaction. After Johnny put on his play clothes, he went out to the backyard. All of a sudden, the mother heard Johnny screaming. She rushed out to the backyard and saw Johnny prostrate over the dog's body and wailing. The mother said, ""But, Johnny, I told you Laddie died.""

Way I see it, people who say the Sherman is a very good tank, are seriously overestimating it. I mean come on, it was nicknamed Ronson for a reason you know. Any tank that has to maneuvre around at close range to the sides and rear of an opposing tank to score a kill is definitely not good. The only notable good Sherman at the end of the war is the VC Firefly, but because US Ordinance doubted the 17 pounder could be fitted onto the tank, it was manufactured in limited quantities. The only notable features of the Sherman was that it was produced in large quantities, had a mechanical reliability that beat the T-34, and came with better secondary equipment such as FM Radio and an elevation gyro-stabiliser.Not to mention the extremely sad stories behind it. Once, a Sherman maneuvered around a building to hide from a Tiger tank. The Tiger shot at the building, and the shell went right through and penetrated the Sherman's turret. There are also tales of German tanks who take out two aligned Shermans in one shot. Also, do you know why you see all these wartime photos of crewmen who have Shermans with spare road wheels and tracks welded onto the hull? Those are efforts to help augment the armour of the Sherman.	0|0|0|0|0|0

"OK, Obi-wan. You're starting to make me suspicious. What do you always ask exactly what I think are the right questions? Own up. Either way, you did not answer my question directly, and I also suspect you know it. ""Does this mean that WPO is not useful to you?"" But you did answer it indirectly. So you get an even more direct question in return: Why make it obvious that you know a lot about Wikipedia, without telling us that you find it useful when you are a very direct person otherwise? For one, you are calling them out on the most inconvenient of all questions for them. If you don't mind, I'm going to take this straight to the source: WPO peeps, what the dealio? I've asked people on WP to put up or shut up. I've asked the WMF to walk their talk. In fact, I've staked my rep several times now, and I'm not done yet. Now I'm asking you, why don't you stop whining for once and show people you can actually do better? On-wiki or off-, Obi-wan certainly isn't the first to question your self-righteous assertions on how to build an online encyclopedia better than Wikipedia. I, for one, have been wondering for a while now. So, let's see what you can do besides making snarky, personal comments. Here's a pot, and here's a kettle. Need I mention what color they are?Onwards with Obi-wan's points. I don't believe in nasty people. Deciding anyone is bad, nasty, etc. has only one purpose; one can feel better about being bad, nasty, etc. to people they've so judged. I don't think this is particularly productive. In fact, IMO it is unbelievably destructive once someone decides- or, more often, others have convinced them- that they themselves are bad people. We could talk about this more in another thread, but we've got to get back on topic here, so. . . You know that the Wikipediocrats are smart. You have spent more time there than you're willing to admit directly. I immediately wonder if it's just in reading or in writing, too. ) They are indeed among the smartest in the WP community reasoning-wise that I've met so far. But emotionally. . . less than average. How do you think many of these smart m'er f'ers ended up getting indef blocked or banned? A lot of them fell from grace, not because they weren't an asset to the community, but because they didn't seem to know when- or they were completely unwilling- to stop fighting for what they saw as justice. That's one part of the answer; many of them are banned or blocked- whether rightly so or not- from editing on Wikipedia. Also, it's normal for someone who has been banished to tell themselves they wish harm on their homeland, while still keeping a great emotional investment in it. You'll hear the same people spout their disdain for Wikipedia almost in the same breath as suggestion to improve it. Frankly, we could speculate about these people's motives and methods til the sun goes down. Let's be more practical about what is best for Wikipedia here. What we, as a Wikipedia community, can't do is ignore them away. And, even if we could, we're doing a piss-poor job of it, because I almost always hear about what's been said on Wikipediocracy from a Wikipedian before I go to the actual site. Ultimately, I go back to my old standard: I don't give a shit where these people come from or what their motives are; all's I know is that they are saying something interesting, and I appreciate the fact that I don't have to gloss over a bunch of posts that are trying to get them to shut up as I read it. Obi-wan, no use playing coy. You know exactly what I'm talking about. D   "	0|0|0|0|0|0

"Penis envyFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaJump to: navigation, searchFor the Crass album, see Penis Envy (album). For the Virgin 1 documentary, see ....Envy.Penis envy in Freudian psychoanalysis refers to the theorized reaction of a girl during her psychosexual development to the realization that she does not have a penis. Freud considered this realization a defining moment in the development of gender and sexual identity for women. According to Freud, the parallel reaction in boys to the realization that girls do not have a penis is castration anxiety.In contemporary culture, the term is sometimes used symbolically or metaphorically to refer to the idea that women wish they had a penis, or to refer to anxieties between men about the size of their genitals.Contents[hide]    * 1 Freud's Theory          o 1.1 Criticisms of Freud’s theory                + 1.1.1 Within psychoanalytic circles                + 1.1.2 Feminist criticisms    * 2 Male penis envy    * 3 See also    * 4 References    * 5 External links[edit] Freud's TheorySigmund Freud introduced the concept of a little girl's interest in—and envy of— the penis in his 1908 article ""On the Sexual Theories of Children,"" but did not fully develop the idea until substantially later in 1914 when his work On Narcissism was published. It was not mentioned in the first edition of Freud's earlier Three Contributions to the Theory of Sex (1905).The term came to significance as Freud gradually refined his views of female sexuality, coming to describe a mental process he believed occurred in girls as they passed through the Electra complex from the phallic stage to the latency stage (see Psychosexual development).In Freud’s psychosexual development theory, the phallic stage (approximately between the ages of 3.5 and 6) is the first period of development in which the libidinal focus is primarily on the genital area. Prior to this stage, the libido (broadly defined by Freud as the primary motivating energy force within the mind) focuses on other physiological areas. For instance, in the oral stage, in the first 12 to 18 months of life, libidinal needs concentrate on the desire to eat, sleep, suck and bite. The theory suggests that the penis becomes the organ of principal interest to both sexes in the phallic stage. This becomes the catalyst for a series of pivotal events in psychosexual development. These events—known as the Oedipus complex for boys and the Electra complex for girls—result in significantly different outcomes for each gender because of differences in anatomy.For girls:    * Soon after the libidinal shift to the penis, the child develops her first sexual impulses towards her mother.    * The girl realizes that she is not physically equipped to have a heterosexual relationship with her mother, since she does not have a penis.    * She desires a penis, and the power that it represents. This is described as penis envy. She sees the solution as obtaining her father’s penis.    * She develops a sexual desire for her father.    * The girl blames her mother for her apparent castration (what she sees as punishment by the mother for being attracted to the father) assisting a shift in the focus of her sexual impulses from her mother to her father.    * Sexual desire for her father leads to the desire to replace and eliminate her mother.    * The girl identifies with her mother so that she might learn to mimic her, and thus replace her.    * The child anticipates that both aforementioned desires will incur punishment (by the principle of lex talionis)    * The girl employs the defence mechanism of displacement to shift the object of her sexual desires from her father to men in general.The offshoot of these events, often cited in the media and colloquially, is that a girl really wants to become her mother, so that she can control her father.A similar process occurs in boys of the same age as they pass through the phallic stage of development. The key differences being that the focus of sexual impulses need not switch from mother to father, and that the fear of castration (castration anxiety) remains. The boy desires his mother, and identifies with his father, whom he sees as having the object of his sexual impulses. Furthermore, the boy’s father, being the powerful aggressor of the family unit, is sufficiently menacing that the boy employs the defense mechanism of displacement to shift the object of his sexual desires from his mother to women in general.Freud thought this series of events occurred prior to the development of a wider sense of sexual identity, and was required for an individual to continue to enter into his or her gen	1|0|0|0|0|0

A weak analogy; a student in Florida will have Facebook friends from many places; not only his home-town, but fellow followers of Facebook interest group or games; we have no reason to suppose Eusebius included anybody who wasn't Christian. Nor do I treat this as fiction: What I  said was that Eusebius may understand those numbers as poorly as his calculation that the Nativity  took place under Herodin 3 BC.He asserts both and they are incompatible...But if it were fiction: One of the points of Crime and Punishment is the populousness of Saint Petersburg; many Russian novels, on the other hand, make a point of the restricted social circle of a country village. If we had no other evidence, we could guess at the size of Saint Petersburg and the sixe of an average village (and especially the nobles in a village{ and not  be faacros of hundreds and thousands off.

"The Ezekiel passage is quoted in the Moloch article in the 1899 Encyclopædidia Biblica as the strongest evidence for the theory that the offerings were considered to be to Yahweh (along with Jeremiah 7.31). Both passages are also cited in the Moloch aritlce in the 1908 Catholic Encyclopedia which reponds rather weakly (in my opinion): ""But this position is to say the least improbable. The texts appealed to may well be understood otherwise, and the prophets expressly treat the cult of Moloch as foreign and as an apostasy from the worship of the true God."" It is cited in  1911 Encyclopædia Britannica: Moloch] with the comment: ""Note, also, the attitude of Ezekiel in xx. 25 seq., 31, references which cannot be explained away."" The article The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: Molech; Moloch] treats it rather strangely, remarking:That this prophet regarded the practice as among the ""statutes that were not good, and ordinances wherein they should not live"" (Ezekiel 20:25) given by God to His people, by way of deception and judicial punishment, as some hold, is highly improbable and inconsistent with the whole prophetic attitude toward it.It is not clear what this means, quoting parts of the passage and paraphasing part of it and then adding ""as some hold"". This article shows itself elsewhere quite aware of the theory that infants were sacrificed to Yahweh. It also brings in bogus Moloch-worship in connection to Carthage. Not a good article in any case.Three different Rabbinical interpretations of the Ezekiel passage appear at . The interpretation by Rashi accords with the most obvious meaning, disliked by TRS, but the writer finds this inconvincing as not in accord with his own theology and prefers another interpretation. That would not be a reason to suppress Rashi's interpretation and the writer does not do so.There is a discussion at  which covers in part John Day's treatment favorably but also discusses the Ezekiel passage in respect to the problem of the people's belief (and apparently Ezekiel's beliefs) that commands which Ezekiel saw as bad came from Yahweh. Note, John Day believes Moloch is not Yahweh, but that still does not answer the problems with that passage.In short, the passage has been long used in support of the theory that the offerings of children lmlk was understood as commanded by Yahweh. It has long been in general a problem pasage. But those who feel that it is being misinterpreted do not suppress it. It is dishonest to present a theory that has been held and still is held and suppress its strongest supporting argument. On could respond by citing the Catholic Encyclopedia response (which seems to me weak). But add it with a citation if you will. But do not suppress.The inclusion is not editorializing by me. I am presenting various theories that are held along with evidence for and against. The Ezekiel passage is cited as part of a common argument that children were sacrificed to Yahweh and normally used as support for that argument, indeed one of the main sources for that argument. My own POV, as much as I have one, is that the evidence is confused, there are good arguments as well as weaknesses in various positions, and that one should present all sides ... though of course full discussion would be a book length article. Your particular POV on a Biblical passages is not grounds to suppress it when cited with a different interpretation, especially when it is normally cited in the Moloch context by sources usually considered reputable, sometimes very much supporting the POV that the sacrifices were to Yahweh. Even when when that interpretation is rejected the Ezekiel passage is still cited in discussion.I don't believe that anything I have included in this article, including the Ezekiel passage, is non-standard for discussion of Moloch. I have tried to present the vanilla arguments and give enough information to allow them to be understood. One obviously cannot agree with all sides. Moloch cannot easily be at once Yahweh, an entirely different god, the name of a kind of sacrifice. Passing through fire cannot be at the same time a human sacrifice or an initiation ceremony. But people do hold different views and the task of the article is to explain these views and give their history.It should be obvious now that your original feeling that this material was novel was incorrect. Please let the normal statements used as arguments stand, regardless of the positions.I am restoring the passage with some reasonable weasel words to make it clearer that this is the expound	0|0|0|0|0|0

"Really? If no intermarrying occured then perhaps you can explain why people from ""nationalist"" background ended up with Anglo surnames (like Gerry Adams) and why people from the ""Ulster-Scots"" background have Irish Gaelic surnames (Like Lenny Murphy).If you honestly believe that there was no intermarriage between the planters and natives then you are brain washed and deluded than the average Loyalist, and thats saying something. It did happen. They intermixed for over two hundred years and when the ""Ulster Scots"" went to America they identified themselves as Irish.Respectable accademic...ahahhaha!"	0|0|0|0|0|0

"First note that my 3 books since 2002:Destiny Matrix,Dark Energy STB II,Super Cosmos,Are part of a SERIES i.e. ""Space-Time and Beyond - The Series"" of which the first in 1975 (which I wrote most of the first edition of, Fred Alan Wolf did a revision years later that I did not participate in because by then the Ira Einhorn murder case broke) sold well and was published by Dutton. There is a lot of junk published by big publishers today. The only difference is that the BIG CORPORATE JUNK has few typographical and grammatical errors.  But the key issue here is: Will the reader who wants to know more about me find it in my books? Obviousy yes. Furthermore there are writings of other people in my books and there are photocopies of important documents like letters from Cap Weinberger on DOD stationary, letter from Bootsie Galbraith wife of US Ambassador to France at the time on official stationary, documents from the late CIA Chief of Station Harold Chipman - who BTW was the model for and wrote some of the episodes for the TV Series ""The Enforcer"".

It seems to be one of the old info from the times when in Wikipedia the need for sourcing them was not so pressing, simply remaining unquestioned until now. I don't know any external source that would present how the Roma have significant cultural similarities with the cultural features that the Balinese borrowed from the Subcontinent. Because of this and because it may be misleading, lacking the presentation of the common cultural features with the Indians (personally, I have in mind to add them when I'll have available time), I consider it would be appropriate to delete this statement.	0|0|0|0|0|0

Edward Brencley Bishop Hi Schwede66, I have had a quick look via Ancestry for Edward. Found him on the Electoral role for 1853 living at Somerfield Farm Canterbury Christchurch with Frederick Augustus Bishop. both yeomen living on a freehold estate valued at £50. They are both still living there in 1861 and Charles Wellingron Bishop is recorded living at the marketplace Christchurch, a storekeeper with two acres of rural land adjoining the town of Kaiapoi on the Island being part of section 321. In 1881 all three are listed plus a fourth. Charles is an accountant in Cambridge Terrace, Edward at Cramner Terrace out of business. Frederick lives with him and is a wine merchant and in addition there is a Rockford Compart Bishop at Armach St also an acountant. There are other entries showing Edward with several plots under his name. Hope this helps, get in touch if you need more info.	0|0|0|0|0|0

":::::::::::::::::So what if Konqueror and other file managers can be made to behave like dual-pane file managers? That's not their ""normal"" (read ""preset"") mode of operation, that's why they (probably) shouldn't fall into that category. Dual-pane behaviour is part of Konqueror's functionality, not its whole functionality. You can play text-mode Tetris from within Emacs. Would you categorize Emacs as a ""Tetris clone""?As for your (conveniently abridged) definition of ""orthodox"", dual-pane file managers are not ""traditional"" in any possible meaning of the word (if there's any ""tradition"" in file management, that's either the shell or spatial file management à la classic Macintosh Finder). They certainly aren't customary nowadays, nor are they more ""generally accepted"" than other approaches. So it actually sounds like you're making my point for me there. Besides, the etymological (read ""original"") definition of ""orthodox"" is ""having the right opinion"", which of course is crazy when applied to any kind of software.

"If the Nazis meant ""Reich"" as ""empire,"" they could have made that clear by translating it that way in English-language material they produced. They did not do so.

It is the official German government translation of a 1937 Hitler speech. Note that ""Reich"" is always ""Reich."" The Nazis did not consider Frederick the Great as having anything to do with the First Reich. They did view him as a great German. The problem is that your case depends on what appears to you to be ""a very accurate translation.""

That's your POV - last time I saw the General Assembly of the United Nations there was an ambassador representing a former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Also, an entity describing itself as the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia recently applied to join the EU. This country's self identifying name obviously varies according to the circumstances. It has two official names out of which one (FYROM) ranks higher in a google search (see above). This is a legitimate term and is not a breach of NPOV (it's not possible - NPOV is not based on names, but on presentation of the facts; using either name, the article is capable of being neutral as long as what is actually going on is told in an unbiased way).	0|0|0|0|0|0
Blackpearll4 - calls herself evidently Mrs. Johnny Depp and Pirate lord-ess and such.

Why would someone devote so much time to 24/7 check the site and on these pages?   Has her judgement become impaired?   Her goal to fuse her love and fantasies with the Walt Disney Company and Pirates of the Caribbean is very clear.  That is a conflict of interest and that is not being neutral.  Sorry if your feelings are hurt,  but if one purchases products, such as Pirates of the Caribbean posters, toys and Walt Disney merchandise and also using emotional love and fantasies for wikipedia / wikinews articles, doesn’t make the articles neutral and it causes a conflict of interest.	0|0|0|0|0|0

Clearly Dragonlance is not available, though if the modules had not spawned numerous other products it may be the title that would have been used.

It should be noted though that extended quotes, properly sourced, are not generally a violation of copyright.  I'd like to see a few examples.  We have never, to my recollection and knowledge, had a legal complaint or threat of any kind about a properly sourced quote.  There could be exceptions such as quoting the entire lyrics of a poem or song in a single block quote, but that isn't what we are talking about here.  We're talking about a block quote of a passage from an academic paper published behind a firewall by Elsevier.  I find it very hard to imagine a serious legal issue with that.	0|0|0|0|0|0

" Sorry that you feel this way, Malangali. I don't suppose that I can persuade you, but I did try and do my homework. Iringa is not offically designated a city at present (unlike Mwanza, Dar and Arusha); you asserted this in the article, but it is simply factually incorrect. A seperate question is whether Iringa can be referred to as a city outside of the Tz government's definition. OK. First, I assure you that ""urban"" can imply either town or city, particularly when contrasted with ""rural"": see urban area. I checked two English language travel guides for Tanzania, both of whom use ""town"". Moreover, I contacted some Tanzanians in Iringa, who agreed that it was ""town"" rather than a ""city"" (not that personal anecdotes are a reliable source in Wikipedia, just to try and convince you that the ""town"" thing is not just from some deluded mzungu insisting on a patronising colonial viewpoint, or whatever it is you've decided I am doing). I don't believe in individual ownership of Wikipedia articles. However, ""city"" is not the best word here, and it's entirely reasonable for me to oppose it. Again, I regret clashing with you on this, and I'm very happy to discuss and change my mind on things, and I'm glad you've improved this article, but I'm afraid I will not simply agree with whatever you say just because I'm English and you (I presume) are a Tanzanian.

"Also, depending on the article you will look at, the socioeconomic equality reason will vary.""The violence was undoubtedly racial. Its prime targets were the Chinese merchants who have flocked to Tibet by road and on a prestigious new train across the roof of the world. The mobs were the losers of Lhasa – the poor who seethe with resentment, outwitted commercially by Chinese traders, out-gunned by the Chinese army and, many fear, ultimately to be outnumbered by Chinese migrants.""Now this is straight from the horse's mouth. The actual Western journalist who was there wrote this- not some MSM that decided to twist the source's words. I thought it was the most NPOV and fair way to just say- they were angry about socioeconomic inequality, inflation, and fear of becoming a minority in their own city. Why is that wrong? It's the most concise, fair and NPOV way to state what they were angry about which caused the rioting."	0|0|0|0|0|0

":I've reworded the lead to try and reduce the ambiguity in the definition.  Hopefully this helps.  The common definition of a flat tax (which is mostly used to imply income taxation as oppose to consumption or a sales tax) is usuall not a horizontal line in regard to average tax rate and progressivity.  Certainly the term of flat tax implies one rate but in practice and legislation, it may be one rate 35% but exempts income up to a certain level - so they don't count 0%.  This is of course regarding a marginal tax rate view and when such an exemption is applied to an average tax rate it becomes a progressive tax.   (talk) 0:57, 25 June 2007 (UTC)"	0|0|0|0|0|0

"SNA, LAS, and SAN are all ""LA Area"" airports, so they would not be served from LAX, even as the HUB that it is.  What you say about connections is simply not true.  I just booked a flight from SEA-FLL, via LAX, right from their website.  The fact that since the mediation they added both BOS and FLL, both *only* going to SFO *and* LAX lends more proof that LAX is a hub.  Also (since the mediation), they announced ORD would be added from *BOTH* SFO *and* LAX, whenever it is added.  I am (as I have been) willing to accept the term ""focus city"", although I strongly believe it to be a hub.  As agreed when the previous mediation ended, if we have yet another mediation, I must insist that all three options are explored: focus city, hub, or nothing.  I'm pretty sure it will come out as a hub. Ron Schnell "	0|0|0|0|0|0

I am not resentful about anything, not matter, I'm Spaniard these days I'm watching movies and very bussy with my first trip to U.K., and I'm preparing a trip to Tarragona too, and another to Huesca. I hope you will don't forget the botany. Wikedia don't pay me money, you know it, It is just for help people. S.M.P. could upset, but she is very bussy these days and besides... Well, mister, please don't quit botany. I hope you will write about it. I don't need to have any user account to write here. There is much work to do and it takes time. I can tell you that I use several books as ""ANIMALI Come sono. Done vivono. Come vivono"" from an italian Edizioni Labor-Milano by a group with G. Scortecci, director del instituto de la Universidad de Génova (Chenoa) translated in 1960 to spanish by ""Vergara Editorial"". So, I translated from spanish to english a text of italian origen. I prefer mostly fishes anphibians and lizards, in this order. But as you know  I used to write too, about plants that are totally unknown for me. I hope in future to visit the Mamut caves in Kentucky and see the blind fishes. We use to create new pages with an account because it is requested by Wikipedia. I wish best regards for  Nadiatalent-Sminthopsis84 she must be very young. I cannot speak about S.M.P. this is internet, you know, she is not writing long time ago, but it is not important neither. I would like that you can try people will write about botany, other Wikipedias have more information. I know that there are other webs with botany topics, but Wikipedia allows to jump between pages. Well, I must watch my movies, and write my homework. You can visit ""http://www.fotolog.com "" if you like about the song. I love basque girls. You could visit Donosti beach ""Playa de la Concha, en San Sebastian"", I hope speak you in the future, and I hope your help too. The articles are best with you and other people writing it. I would like write to Nadiatalent-ST84, but she has forbidden me, and S.M.P. could read about it too. Well a hug for you, mister P.C.W. (Gran jefe NubeBlanca) from me: C.C.

The Afghan government may not reward the death penalty for prostitution but the Afghan people do. This article is to explain about prostitution in Afghanistan so it should cover every thing, including how Afghans view it or feel about it. Historically, Afghanistan's people lived according to their local traditions. Each region has their own local rules that they abide by and much of the country hasn't been governed by a central government. In the south and east of the country I doubt you find a single prostitution service because that area is tribal society and they follow Taliban style rules.	0|0|0|0|0|0

An ugly personal attack, by a person who has in essence defamed a widely respected organization  the National Civilian Community Corps  by posting false and misleading information at the Wikipedia website.If your / Wikipedia's best idea is that what should happen next is that I enter into a prolonged dialogue with that person, hoping to reason with him/her, while he/she continues to exert control over content and issue ugly diatribes, then your processes leave a great deal to be desired. A responsible adult  a real Editor  should have interceded long ago.He/she and the others working over the NCCC text at this time seem to feel that any statement introduced by the phrase ""According to ___,"" does not belong at Wikipedia. As I read it, there was objection at one of your pages to placing references at the end of that phrase rather than at the end of the quotation. Why an encyclopedia would have as a policy including bald claims (as if fact) without reference to the source in its text eludes me.

"Hi I just wanted to comment on the organization of this stub. I think it would be easier to read if you separated some of the bigger paragraphs into smaller paragraphs. Also, none of the information under ""Applications"" is cited. If this section wasn't written by you and you haven't found any evidence to support these statements, then it might be necessary to rewrite this section. Under references, ""Reference List"" is misspelled. Also, it would probably be best to integrate all sources under one reference section. If you could incorporate more images to this topic, that would also be helpful to see a visual representation relating the hologram to the holonomic brain theory. The analogies in ""The Hologram and Holonomy"" under Theory Overview was very helpful to understand the concept.  "	0|0|0|0|0|0

Well, I guess I'd better get going on this. For my own reference (and in case anyone else wants to dig in), here's my current thinking on the final article list: Light-emitting diode: the primary article, with references to other articles in the LED family; would include packaging and material from current Electrical polarity of LEDs Organic light-emitting diode: keep this separate since there seems to be a lot of good material here, although I haven't looked it over for redundancy LED circuit: the circuitry surrounding an LED (including material from LED power sources, Thermal management of high power LED, and LED as light sensor) LED physics: the internals of how LEDs function (including List of LED failure modes and Light extraction in LEDs) LED lighting: using LEDs to cast light on other objects (including material from Solid-state lighting and LED lamp) [LED stage lighting]] (keep as-is) LED beacon: using LEDs to call attention to an object (including material from LED anti-collision light, LED anchor light and Motorcycle LED Lighting) LED display: using LEDs to deliver information (e.g. status, images, video, text) (yes, there already is an LED display article, but it only covers video displays, which is overly specific given the broad title) LED art: self-explanatory (including material from Blinky (novelty) and LED Throwie) LED products: random LED-based products that I'm not sure fit elsewhere (e.g. LED Incapacitator, Individually Modulated LED, LED printer, DPL Therapy)I'm least certain of the LED products page. I was thinking to gather together a set of LED-based products that (for the most part) don't really deserve their own articles. I'm no longer sure this is a useful path, though; perhaps these articles should just be improved in-place (or nominated for deletion). Thoughts?	0|0|0|0|0|0

"Responses:1 - I was not referring to this, only your posts on Wikipediocracy recently.2 - I was not referring to these events dating back to 2009, it does not appear relevant to your actions now.3 - I am sure people can refer to the Arbcom case for the facts if they wish.

If you wish to have my help on Commons, please leave me a note there.7 - I briefly looked at 's contributions to assess if he was active as an OTRS volunteer on Commons.

" Ettlinger Being Jewish + His Family Hi all,I learned about Adrian’s death after a web search yielded this Wikipedia article (see my post of ""In Memoriam"" about him to the Freecell Solving Discussions mailing list), and since he was a good Internet friend of mine, and we corresponded extensively on E-mail, I’d like to help with the English Wikipedia article about him. In any case, Ettlinger told me in a private E-mail that he was Jewish (at least by descent - he wasn’t an observant/religious Jew and said something about being a deist), and so I think his article should be added to the American Jews by occupation category. One problem I see there is that I don't see any sub-category for Jewish American Engineers and/or Jewish American software developers (he was both). I know that Richard Stallman is a Jewish (also only by decent) American software developer, and he belongs to the categories ""American computer programmers"" and ""American Jews"" and there are naturally many others. I have kept most of the E-mails with him, so can upload them in part to my web-site or elsewhere for citation, nut will it be considered a self-reference? So what should be done?Adrian also told me about his family (two children if I remember correctly, and four or five grandchildren, all but one are attending university now), but I don't think he mentioned any names. Should they be mentioned as well?I'll try to improve the entry about him in other respects. Thanks to all the Wikipedia editors who wrote what exists up to now based on the research.  "	0|0|0|0|0|0

Editing Edits on wiki improve by evolution: only the best survives. They become best by change after change after change. I find I make two kinds of edits. Ones which add content, and ones which improve language. I fancy I am quite good at writing smooth prose, but very often it is not possible to do this immediately. If I have a fact to insert or point to make, the primary thing is to make or insert it. Then someone else can smooth it along, or i may do so myself when I have more time, or after leaving the piece and re-reading it. It can be quite difficult to write good prose in one go, because you do not spot your mistakes. As to our last exchange in Severus Snape, yes I agree, I put in a clumsy statement, but I was trying to express a particular point. You improved the flow, but slightly altered my point. I changed it again, back a little to my original intention, though you also added something. Cheers.	0|0|0|0|0|0

At any rate, they can't quite be considered translations, because as an adjective, ""Rube Goldberg"" is more specific, describing an overly complex mechanical device or a complex series of interdependent actions; Heath Robinson, in contrast, is more surrealistic or fantasy-oriented.  LDCAs an American, I would like to say that to me a bum is a homeless person as much as the butt, a flat is an apartment, and rubbish certainly is trash. Granted, I agree that a fag is not a cigarette, and underground is not a subway. I may do some actual research, and come back and fiddle with that list. - Eean.I think Americans certainly understand the use of ""bum"" for ""butt"", ""rubbish"" for ""trash"", and (to a lesser degree) ""flat"" for ""apartment"".  But we don't use those terms much.  Point to a container for discarded things, and an American will say ""that's a trash can""; a Brit will say ""that's a rubbish bin"".  Americans are more likely to use ""rubbish"" in the sense of ""bullshit"". LDCI deleted the following pair: ""limited (Ltd)"" and ""incorporated"", since they actually mean different things. ""Incorporated"" means a corporation; ""limited"" means a limited liability corporation (you can also have unlimited liability corporations, and no liability corporations). British (and Australian also) Ltd is roughly equivalent to American LLC.  SJKI would say 'torch' was much more common than 'pocket lamp' which sounds quite old-fashioned. 'Flashlight' would be more easily recognised than the latter.Yes, I'd call it a ""torch"", and it would probably be labeled as a ""flashlight"" in its manufacturer's packaging. IMO, 'torch' is colloquial British English  The AnomeOh, so ""flashlight"" is correct British usage? (My dictionary said [Am.] and the Oxford English Dictionary carried ""flashlight"" only in the meaning of photography.) Then I'll remove the entry again. AxelBoldt"	0|0|0|0|0|0
"New Aboriginal ArticleGundagai is a place of considerable reputed Aboriginal cultural significance, with both archaeological sites and antropological associations related to sacred and spiritual beliefs of the local tribes.Acknowledgement of countryAcknowledgement of Country is a protocol used in Australia in relation to Indigenous Australian affairs.Reconcilitation Australia, 24 March 2010, Available [online] http://www.reconciliation.org.au/home/reconciliation-resources/facts-figures/q-a-factsheets/welcome-to-and-acknowledgement-of-countryThe Gundagai area is part of the traditional lands of the Wiradjuri speaking people before and post European settlement, and also holds national significance to Indigenous Australians.  The floodplains of the Murrumbidgee below the present town of Gundagai were a frequent meeting place of the Wiradjuri. One indication of the ancient, sacred cultural landscape that is North Gundagai is the bora ring that has been identified close to town.The location of Gundagai on a sizeable prehistoric highway, (the Murrumbidgee River), along with the significant and sacred Aboriginal ceremonial ground across all of North Gundagai, and other ancient archaeology, indicates it would have been an important ceremonial, mining, manufacturing and trading place for Aboriginal people before the arrival of the Europeans.Kabaila, P. (2005), 'High Country Footprints: Aboriginal pathways and movement in the high country of southeastern Australia: Recognising the ancient paths beside modern highways', Pirion Publishing Canberra  As with all ancient sacred places, particularly within still continuing Australian Aboriginal culture, the sacredness of Gundagai's amazing Australian Aboriginal cultural landscape continues despite colonial and later intrusion.Gundagai Aboriginal Elders, Jimmy Clements and John Noble, attended the 1927 opening of the new Federal Parliament House in Canberra by the Duke of York. Jimmy Clements also known as King Billy whose traditional name was 'Yangar',http://australianmuseum.net.au/Aboriginal-Group-Sculpture-1925 walked forward to respectfully salute the Duke and Duchess of York (later King George VI of the United Kingdom and Elizabeth the Queen), and after that the two Elders were formally presented to the Royal couple as prominent citizens of Australia.http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/3853897?Australian dialogue meetingAboriginal leaders Pat Dodson and Noel Pearson; the former Chief of the Australian Army and Governor of West Australia, Lieutenant General John Sanderson; and current Australian business leaders, met at a remote property on the Murrumbidgee River near Gundagai in September 2008 on the first stages of an Australian Dialogue to promote constitutional reform and structural change for Indigenous Australian people.  Galarrwuy Yunupingu, Northern Territory Indigenous leader, could not be at the gathering of esteemed senior Australians but was kept informed of the progress of talks.Rintoul, S. 12 Sept 2008 'Dialogue gets under way at indigenous leaders' retreat' The Australian, http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24332900-5013172,00.htmlNatural phenomenaA feeling of awe and reverence for that Almighty power that formed the universe was had in Gundagai at the appearance of the comet on Saturday 21 December 1844.http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/28651495?

The fact that Azeris are mixed Turkic speaking people that sprung from the Turkish invasion points to the fact that they did not just appear.  They were and are in the location that was Arran that consistent of Albanians, and Iranian tribes.  Furthermore, the fact that the entire area was called Arran, then for some reason was renamed Azerbaijan is another indication that Azeris were not a Turkic speaking group that just living side by side in the Caucus next to the Sakas.  No one said Azeris in the north do not have differences when compared to other Iranians, in fact Iranians are a multi-ethnic, multi lingual group, much like the Kurds in the west have a different language/customs, as do Balochies in the south.  What happened to Iranians in Arran intermittingly, in which the Turks invaded their tribes, and the Albanians were driven out, and imposed their language on them via Elite Dominance, does not change their original ancestry.  You have again failed to give a single rationale as to where the Azeris came from, why they even appear/are part of Iran, even today, and why these ethnic groups even have a Persian culture?  In all, you can concentrate on their differences, but fail to explain where did Azeris come from?  It is astonishing how some choose to skip many important facts, and write pages of texts about Germanic peoples in an article about Iranian peoples.   I think I’ll stop at that.	0|0|0|0|0|0

Stooges are the nickname for the fans on Murphy's site... and if you want to feel all self pitying we can end this conversation now and go down the path.   Here is what you are not getting- Shitapedia is NOT the FBI or my University.  If you want to have an encylopedic entry on me then that entry HAS TO be accurate.  Simply check the laws- you have HUGE leeway to defame celebrities and public figure and you do so freely.  BUT that stops with a non public figure.  You can try to have your cult argue that I am a public figure, but when 100 out of 100 randomly selected people can't identify me, then that game is over.  As a non public figure you do NOT have much leeway as regards defaming me.  I don't need a specialist- if you are going to keep a file on me it is going to be a file that I sign off on- period.  Unfortunately for your cultists, I have some resources to fight you on that, even if it is just sending people to vandalize.

Now I find that this one IP hopping user is ruining it all... By now even you are of the impression that I'm edit warring, but if you did look thru you would have seen that he/she started it!!! I've had enough of this guy so I will wait for a few days, then I will go thru Ministry of Defence (india), its talk page, and if he hasn't replied, I will revert my edit with an unemotional summary and let it go... As much as I'm interested in these articles I will let it go, and leave it you guys to do what you feel is right...I must say that you guys have been supremely helpful and I will always repect that... I would still wish to clear my bad image by stating that I will let this go and be the better person by not getting involved in such a useless fight... Thank You and Forgive me!!!	0|0|0|0|0|0

I think the notability comes from the notability of the user, and how it was used. for example John Allen Muhammad is one man, not an organization, but his use of the Bushmaster XM-15 is very notable. I would also like to note that the Glock pistol article does not list all the police forces that use that sidearm.

"Impumozhi and his knowledge (or lack of) about rajputs Incident 1: Impumozhi accuses rajputs of fabricating history on Hada pageRead this page for a little entertainment  in particular, the last three sentences, setting out the historical repurcussions of that hilarious (and probably fictitious) incident. Is this fit for an encyclopedia? Leave aside veracity, just the choice of words? Yet nobody dare change one comma or fullstop in that page: it is ""owned"" by that presiding deity of obduracy, the learned protagonist of every page with a remote ""rajput"" connection. Impumozhi's lack of knowledge exposedHis claim about Hada's character  being funny and un-encyclopaedic is actually taken from James Tod's Annals and Antiquities page 384 and 385 Vol-II: On the death of the queen Joda Bae, Akbar commanded a court mourning; and that all might testify a participation in their master's affliction, an ordinance was issued that all the Rajput chiefs, as well as the Moslem leaders, should shave the moustache and the beard. To secure compliance, the royal barbers had the execution of the mandate. But when they came to  quarters of the Hadas, in order to remove these tokens of manhood, they were repulsed with buffets and contumely. Then enemies of Rao Bhoj Hada aggravated the crime of this resistance and insinuated to the royal ear that the outrage upon the barbers was accompanied with expressions insulting to memory of the departed princess, who it will be remembered was a rajputani of Marwar.  Akbar, forgetting his vassal's gallant services, commanded that Rao Bhoj should be pinioned and forcibly deprived of his moustache. He might as well have commanded the operation on a tiger. The Hadas flew to there arms, the camp was thrown into tumult, and would have soon presented a wide scene of blood-shed, had not the emperor, seasonably repenting of his folly repaired to the Boondi quarters in person.

I've been working for some time on category:Roman bridges, but you certainly provide new infos here. This is what a webpage says about the Alconetar bridge: destroyed in the 13th century, 3 arches left, moved in 1972 - I hope they did not change the arch structure then. Here the most authoritative photo: http://users.servicios.retecal.es/jomicoe/Alconetar.JPG  El puente de Alconétar, sobre el Tajo  en Garrovillas (Cáceres) cerca de Alcántara, estaba en la Vía de la Plata. Debió de ser también monumental. Fue destruido por los árabes en el siglo XIII y nunca después reconstruido. Hoy día es un puente sin río. Al construir el pantano de Alcántara hubiera quedado sepultado por las aguas. En el año 1972 se trasladaron sus restos a un nuevo emplazamiento. Apenas quedan tres arcos de los 13 que tuvo. Se aprecia su solidez en sus fuertes machones. As for the Pons Fabricius, there are some Roman bridges (and even more medieval ones) whose arches are designed somewhere between semi-circular and segmental. This is only natural as a demanding structure the segmental arch bridge could not have been invented in a day, but must have been reasonably the result of a lengthy development process. This means there are certainly transitory forms between the two types, what we need in every single case is the span/rise ratio of the bridge to make qualified judgements on its segmental or semi-circle character.	0|0|0|0|0|0

Accusation of plagiarism =Ynhockey, you have made a rather serious accusation  plagiarism  against me: .However, plagiarism occurs when someone else's material is misrepresented as one own's work. How can my edits be plagiarism, since I clearly referenced the source material  Haaretz?  I think you have confused plagiarism and copyright. From plagiarism:Plagiarism is not copyright infringement. While both terms may apply to a particular act, they are different transgressions. Copyright infringement is a violation of the rights of a copyright holder, when material protected by copyright is used without consent. On the other hand, plagiarism is concerned with the unearned increment to the plagiarizing author's reputation that is achieved through false claims of authorship.ContentsYou wil find that using the 2 sentences in question fall under fair use.Regardless, plagiarism is a serious and, in this case, untrue accusation to make and I consider your behaviour a violation of WP:CIVIL.	0|0|0|0|0|0

" Unblock Request: Fuck you, unblock me! {{unblock|HAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA UNBLOCK ME OR I WILL VANDALISE MORE!!!!It had been six years since we had graduated from college, and for the first time since graduation, all three of us were together again. From the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home, it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact, the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable.Having returned to my cozy, semi-secluded home in the suburbs, we all sat in the living room, sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives. With the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol, it could have been any of our final two years of college together: The three of us, tight-knit friends-with-benefits, sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together. Then, Justine and Beth had been roommates while I lived in another dorm across the main quad; now, they were much-welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend.As I sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine, I allowed my eyes to truly linger on Justine as she told Beth about a recent situation at work. The Florida sun had certainly added a glow to Justine's skin, and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder-length brown hair. As when we were in college together, she wore virtually no make-up, just a thin gloss upon her lips – an enticing strawberry flavor, as I had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails. Her red dress was indeed elegant, with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage, a display which Beth and I both certainly appreciated. The long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt, one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well-toned thigh. The red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes. Surprisingly, however, she wore hoop earrings, something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe.The conversation turned back toward me, but a few minutes later, the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other. I took the opportunity to once again study Beth, and was equally impressed. While noticeably shorter than Justine, Beth was also paler in complexion, a testament to living in northern Canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research. As in college, Beth preferred the color black for her outfits: a somewhat-tight sweater, form-fitting slacks, and a pair of low heels. Four tiny earrings adorned each ear, plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril. Beth's black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front, and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to Justine.It felt so good to be in their presence once again. Especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college, I was thankful that I had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me. I had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy, but for now, I was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa.The intimacy began when we finally went to bed... together. I was on my back under the covers, with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder. An arm wrapped around each of them, I held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest, dipped a finger into my navel, brushed my thighs through the sweatpants I typically wore to bed, caressed my stiffening manhood. My eyes closed, I reveled in their touches: inherently familiar, yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time.No words were needed. And as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me, I smiled to myself in the darkness, having always enjoyed watching Beth and Justine in their own intimate encounters. But eventually, their touches slowed and ultimately ceased, their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep. I stayed awake a little longer, immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life.I awoke in the morning to the scent of French Roast coffee, faint yet unmistakable. Justine was gone, clearly the one who had brewed the morning nectar, while Beth and I held each other as sh	1|0|1|0|1|0

Current thinkingOne line of thought is that 'paraphrenia' is basically a psychotic illness (e.g. schizophrenia). The differences (e.g. preservation of personality)are simply due to the fact that the psychosis starts later, and so the person's personality has already formed (v.s Schizophrenia which often startsearly, and therefore disrupts personality development).

Criticism > The Oohashi et al. (2006) results reveal some interesting contradictions. While full bandwidth sound was preferred to CD limited bandwidth (over a speaker), the test for the ultrasonic music band was inaudible when reproduced alone. Additionally, the preference for HFC was not replicated when using headphones, only with speaker presentation, ruling out the ear as the means by which the effect was produced. These are not contradictions. They are an essential feature of the study, specified and discussed in the paper. There is no contradiction here. Out it goes.(  ) Contrary evidence and ABX tests Oohashi et al. pictured human brains when the test persons were either exposed or not exposed to ultrasonic stimulus. ABX tests only tell, what differences test persons consciously perceive or not during the test. If same research methods had been used and results were drastically different, that should be called contradictory.   I will state that even more generally than previous: There are certainly many signals and irritants that human beings can be unconsciously exposed to, but nevertheless they affect human's well-being and happiness. For example several chemicals or radioactivity would do that. We just don't know the whole truth about ultrasonic signals yet. Some signals could be processed half consciously in human's brains: One feels restless or nervous but still does not know why.	0|0|0|0|0|0

Disambiguation PageDoes this need a disambiguation page? I would argue that the other Billy West is not prominent enough to cause confusion. There is not even any article linked for him, and the Primrose article is pretty minor. First, I moved this to the bottom of the page because that's where people usually expect new material to be. This way people looking will be more likely to see this question, no biggie. To answer your question; no, I don't think this really needs a disambiguation page for the same reasons that you listed.	0|0|0|0|0|0
"Romanization for words of English originOn the MOS:JP talk page, a discussion has been started about including or not including romanizations for words of English origin, such as Fainaru Fantajī in  (for the sake of simplicity, I called this case ""words of English origin"", more information on semantics here).Over the course of a month, it has become apparent that both the parties proposing to include or not include those romanizations cannot be convinced by the arguments or guidelines brought up by the other side. Therefore, a compromise is trying to be found that will satisfy both parties. One suggestion on a compromise has been given already, but it has not found unanimous agreement, so additional compromises are encouraged to be suggested.One universally accepted point was to bring more users from the affected projects in to help achieve consensus, and you were one of those selected in the process.What this invitation is: You should give feedback on the first suggested compromise and are highly encouraged to provide other solutions.What this invitation is not: This is not a vote on including or excluding such romanizations. This is not a vote on compromises either.It would be highly appreciated if you came over to the MOS:JP talk page and helped find a solution. Thank you in advance.   "	0|0|0|0|0|0

Thanks for the praise.  I'm taking Wikipedia a lot more seriously now than I used to.  I have to admit that a few months ago I did silly things like vandalize articles.  I never really didn't anything slanderous, just silly and stupid stuff.  Recently, I've been doing my best to contribute positively to Wikipedia and I've even been correcting the same sort of vandalism I used to take part in.	0|0|0|0|0|0
"Reply from ColonelHenryI have been pissed this week, I admit. Why? First, last week, I get harassed by one hypocritical ""rule nazi"" editor taking things too far (SummerPhD) so when I pointed out her similar shortcomings and intransigence and said frankly ""this user is an asshole"" and explain why and state ""this is the kind of user that drives editors away from wikipedia"" I get blocked for 24-hours.  I say ""asshole"" once, I get blocked.  She calls me a ""dick"" over a dozen times, and gets warned.  Go figure. I hate nitpicking rule nazis because they end up proving themselves to be hypocrites, and unfortunately without fool other meek fools who tend to be admins tend to side with the rule nazi. In the midst of that Daniel Case continued to plow ahead insisting on a rushed revision of ALONJ that no one else raised as a concern (so, not immediately dire) after being asked first politely and respectfully several times to ""wait until after TFA"" and he still ignored it.  If someone politely asked me to wait a few days before doing a drastic edit on an article they worked on that was getting a little attention, I would...because I find it akin to telling a concert pianist to change their entire concert programme an hour before the recital. Only when I responded in anger did he pull back on the reins and realize ""hey, maybe I should wait till after TFA.""  A little deference on his part would have gone a long way.  I'm not averse to his edits, but seriously, after TFA would have been more than fine.  I considered it insulting, and his refusal to listen to a polite request stated by both myself and the other major contributor to the article was considerably disrespectful. And then when the article I've worked on becomes TFA we get inundated with constant vandalism and petty edits that were not necessary (i.e. people like you, Kevjonesin, insisting on 19th instead of nineteenth).  Is that really a necessary place to make a stand and pick a fight? Seriously, don't you have better things to do with your time?  I'd rather argue over an analysis of Hegel's influence on Nietzsche's ""Will to Power"" or Hindu mysticism in Eliot's Four Quartets than bicker about things as meaningless as whether honour should be spelled -or or -our.As for why, I like ""nineteenth"" as opposed to 19th, several style guides (including Chicago/Turabian) advocates it, and growing up I was taught that all numbers under 20 should be spelled out. Whether cutting two dozen letters from an article going to 19th and 20th is going to make a difference for ""brevity's sake"" on a 40-page article, is a lame claim and frankly a waste of time for both of us. I like the aesthetic of it spelled out, it's allowed, and the option of spelling it out is a bonus in an article to avoid confusion with too many other numbers.  When considering such an unnecessary subjective edit, deference should be made to style set by the editors who spent months on an article...and when nothing is wrong to it, deference is entirely warranted.  That isn't ownership, it's just courtesy and good judgment. After all, if I stood in your yard while you were painting your house gray and proceeded to insist you to paint your house orange, you'd tell me to ""kick rocks.""As far as I'm concerned, this is over. Move on. I am not addressing this any further, because nonsense like this keeps me from contributing and convinces me to leave Wikipedia again, and this time for good. If Hell is other people, Wikipedia constantly proves itself to be the eighth and ninth circle.   "	1|0|1|0|0|0

"Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/History_and_geographyThe following RfC was posted earlier today in order to end this dispute once and for all. I trust that Philip Gronowski will abide by the decision of the administrator who makes a decision concerning my dispute.  Rossville, Staten Island - As part of an ongoing edit war,  has been arbitrarily reverting all additions of external links to the article as ""removal of spam"". These external links, which had been part of the article since it's creation, are not spam, and were unjustifiably removed. One external link links to an article about the 150th anniversary of the oldest Roman Catholic Church in Staten Island, which is located in the neighborhood. Another external link links to a website created by a former resident who describes what it was like to grow up in the area before it was built up. It seems to me that this Philip Gronowski character, who has recently been resoundingly rejected in his candidacy for RfA, is not making legitimate revisions based on the rules of Wikipedia, but on his own interpretation of what is ""spam"". I'd like to request that this article be submitted for third party arbitration, and I have exhausted all attempts at a compromise with Mr. Gronowski. I will abide by any decision made by an impartial administrator concerning this dispute. Thank you very much for your consideration.  "	0|0|0|0|0|0

"Well, let's try again (one more time).Re """"commonsenual"" = WP:OR. Regardless of sui generis it has all the characteristics of belligerent occupation (Glantz et al.)"" ""Commonsensual"" is not OR. Occupation sensu stricto is something quite concrete, and it is regulated by various international conventions. For instance, Guggenheim lists three different forms of occupation, and one of them refers to something quite unique. Therefore, we can speak about the ""occupation sensu stricto"" and ""occupation following an armistice"". That is what I mean under ""commonsensual"" occupation, and that is how a reader will understand it.Re belligerent occupation, I do not deny the fact that some sources do describe it in this way; however, other sources (majority of sources) use different terminology. Therefore, the reference to one more source that uses the terminology you like does not change a picture much. I propose to present both viewpoints - you reject the very opportunity that a second viewpoint exists. Therefore, it is your arguments that do not hold water.Re Malksoo, please, re-read his works again. And, since both you and I can draw different conclusions from different pieces of Malksoo's text, below is a quote from his own explanation of his own position, made specifically for us:"" The Baltic Sattes were occupied in June 1940 and annexed (incorporated) by the USSR in August 1940. Thus, both occupation and annexation DID happen. The fact of annexation - and that the USSR proceeded with its policies from the presumption that these territories were its own, not occupied - changed the nature of the occupation, if not in terms of law than at least in terms of political realities. For example, when 1980 Moscow olympic games took place, the olympic regatta took place in Tallinn. This cannot be a typical occupation situation.However, it is important that the article would make clear that in the eyes of the predominant Western opinion and post-1991 restored Baltic States themselves, the Soviet annexation remained illegal. In this sense, illegal annexation equals extended occupation and the whole debate is a pseudo-debate. The annexation - since it remained illegal - did not create any extra rights to the annexing power, the USSR. If the article makes that aspect clear, I would be perfectly fine with the title of the article being changed to ""Occupation and Annexation of the Baltic States"". In fact, I would recommend such change because it takes more precisely (closer to the facts) into account the complex nature of the Soviet rule in the Baltic States.""What else do you need? Malksoo clearly says that in the case of the Baltic states both occupation and annexation took place, and we can speak about continued occupation in this sense (but not in others. P.S.) llegal annexation equals extended occupation. In other words, we can speak about occupation in a context of the state continuity of the Baltic states, and I never argued against that. Again, what synthesis you accuse me in?Re ""there is no bridge between the Baltic and Soviet/official Russian positions; there is no in-between or continuum of scholarship, it's one or the other;"" Wrong. There is a Baltic position, position of different foreign states (which was different from state to state and from time to time), positions of scholars (western, Baltic, Russian), Soviet positions (different during 1950s-70s and during Perestroika) and official Russian position.Re ""From Glantz to Malksoo, a belligerent occupation."" Glantz is an authoritative expert in the military aspects of the WWII, not in the legal aspects; Malskoo does not consider Soviet intervention in 1940 as a military operation at all. The only aggressive step, according to him, was a naval blockade.Re ""Baltic citizens became a lower class as their homelands were ""colonized"""" Probably. However, other sources tell that the real economic and political situation in these republics were much better than in other parts of the USSR, hence extensive influx of migrants. Was it possible if they had a colonial status?I expect you to treat my arguments seriously.  "	0|0|0|0|0|0

Maybe a line or two would cover it since Wikipedia isn't a Crystal Ball, it can't predict possible future events or expansions. NBC http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/15420361/ says that the probability of expansion are low citing lack of arenas and insufficient profits. This article is pretty interesting http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/writers/ian_thomsen/02/13/international.expansion/index.html, however at this point it seems more like fantasy talk than any concrete plans. see also http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2614550	0|0|0|0|0|0

It should be noted that traditioning in most martial arts including Muay Thai(which mostly is not a martial art anymore due to the adoption of instinctive fighting techniques of the upper body(boxing as it is called)and many other martial art techniques not exclusive to Maui Boran or Maui Tha, etc...) women are not considered true martial artists anyway. That is because the arts are designed, used, mastered, and needed by men and its techniques are supposed to play to the strengths of a man. A woman's training dating back centuries was an emphasis on wounding the target with a basic attack and running. This is one of the many reasons escorts where provided. It is sad what has happened to Karate and TKD in the modern schools on average in the emphasis on sport and money from children practioners(by way of parent(s), unconditioned elders, and women. But that is another debate. Regardless, female fighters are not to show any signs of claiming equality to a male fighter since the potential is clearly lacking. Like it or not, gender is of the physical, mental, and in my opinion the spiritual as well. Play to its strengths, not its weaknesses. It is the opposite sex that helps you compensate for your weaknesses due to your gender.	0|0|0|0|0|0

You may have a personal relationship with the subject, or have personal reasons for supporting him, but taking personal offence on his behalf isn't useful to improvement of the article.  (2) You keep conflating my changes with those of someone else.  The use of the word ""caused"" appears to be the major source of your dudgeon, and I didn't make that change.  You keep reverting all changes wholesale  including changes made for reasons purely of style  rather than picking out the ones which are bothering you.

Until the claims of Lamo and the US government have been established in a court of law, we CANNOT use the word-of-God to state their claims are true.  As for the torture citation, if you read the article (and many others also easily obtainable), you will see that it's the newspaper which chose to put ""torture"" in quotation marks, not the experts they consulted.  We are not interested in the editorial opinion of the newspaper, but rather the opinion of the experts whom the newspaper has consulted  who clearly states that Manning's treatment amounts to torture.

"I understand your point. I simply do not believe it to be valid. During the period in question, the RC Church did not have large armies at its disposal. It relied on secular powers to take heed of its views. In France, Louis, a loyal Catholic hated the concept of religious toleration. The RC Church, at this time, were also opposed to this principle (one that has become so widely accepted in 'western' societies that it is often difficult to imagine a time before). Louis, with the tactic support of leading Churchman, ordered acts of anti-Protestant terror. (Let's be completely honest, without the tactic approval of the Church, would a devout Catholic have been committed to such a course of action?) Some leading Churchman celebrated the outcome - a France almost completely 'cleansed' of Protestants. Now, in all the material the criticism of the RC Church is so obviously implied that this shouldn't need re-emphasising. A modern historian would not write: ""The following is a criticism of the RC Church..."" That is how junior school children begin their English composition answers!   "	0|0|0|0|0|0

"{{unblock | I am appealing a 48-hour block that was placed on me before I could post my response via the administrator's message board. I apologize in advance for the length of this but I believe that it's necessary to include all of these details. I wrote a summary at the end so that administrator's could get an overview if they don't have time to read the whole statement.I will be addressing the claim that I violated the 1RR rule in the second paragraph of this article: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yitzhak_ShapiraAccording to WP:BLP, ""Biographies of living persons  must be written conservatively and with regard to a subject's privacy..."" In a book written in a foreign language, with a lot of jargon, there are often competing translations/interpretations. And a book written in such a hotspot is sure to generate numerous quotes, misquotes, dubious translation and out-of-context statements. As per WP:BLP I think it stands to reason that a more conservative and less sensationalist translation be used, and for the same reason, the quotes should not be taken out of the context that the book uses them in.With than in mind on the 18th of February, I improved certain parts of the paragraph in question in order to make to make it more compatible with WP:BLP based on this source.user:Zero0000 -  responded to one of my edits by stating that [en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yitzchak_Ginsburgh&diff;=538816167&oldid;=538810305 I ""can't read.""] And in what seemed to be extremely inappropriate comment for a Wikipedia administrator, told me in as many words to get off Wikipedia.""Take a break"" I didn't take nicely to being told that by an administrator and thus began a heated series of exchanges during which I was told by said individual that I had ""behavioral problems.""Said individual also decided to respond to my comments by invoking what seemed to me to intimidation tactics ""I started to write a complaint against you"" (why do I need to know that? He can let me know when he posts it) and then later responding to another edit he didn't like by saying that ""it was on my charge sheet.""Now the reason I am writing about the behavior of said individual is to give some context or the 1RR issue:After posting my version of the paragraph, user:Zero0000 subsequently changed it to this.I will post only the first few words of his statement and the source:Source: ""There is a reason to kill babies [on the enemy side""]user:Zero0000: [""Babies [on the enemy side may be killed .""]After those first few words, user:Zero0000 continues quoting the rest of the paragraph. Now at best this is a serious distortion. And when you consider that article is dealing with a scholarly work which contains hundreds of sometimes competing, sometimes contradictory sources, rationales, theories, proposals, and ideas; many of which are subsequently discounted, limited in scope, or just tossed by the wayside, the disparity the statement ""may be done"" and ""there is a reason"" is even greater.Aside from the distortion mentioned above, in contradiction to WP:BLP user:Zero0000 also opted for a particularly liberal out-of-context translation.Why did user:Zero0000 replace my edit with his own. His statement:(prefer source with an actual quotation)As I showed above, he didn't use an actual quotation.Furthermore, after seeing his comment, I searched but wasn't able to find any Wikipedia reference to a such a preference, leading me to believe that he was intent on just superimposing his own WP:JUSTDONTLIKEIT on me without explanation. His actions above combined with the general hostility cited above led me to be believe that this was another front in the multi-pronged campaign of intimidation that he was engaging in (i.e. encouraging me ""take a break"").NEWLIN	0|0|0|0|0|0

"I think the possibility of a corrupt core of admins is a problem worth asking candidates on. So if anybody else posted this exact question there wouldn't be a problem with it? Particularly, I imagine, if it were a well respected admin with an impeccable record positing it?I read each of the candidates statements, and used that to judge if this question would be useful, look at the time between asking the candidates questions. Also look at the ""ignore all evidence"" question, this occurred to me as I was going along and it must be regarded as a general behavioural question when linked to the ""5 days"" question, plus this shows it was not a ""spam"" question to all candidates, I did pay attention to their statements.This is the question I posed to select candidates.What general concerns do you think are raised by the 5 days of silence from the community's admins in this ANI? Are there any other general concerns which arise from the ANI?Do these quotes;ameliorate, add to or amplify concerns?Do you agree with the substance of the Jehochman quotes?If an essay WP:IGNORE ALL THE EVIDENCE were written, what concerns would be behind it, and what could be done about them?If you can point me to another ANI where lies and deceit by two admins within an ANI were ignored by the other admins in attendance for somewhere close to 5 days, then I will ask exactly the same question of those select candidates, substituting this with that example. Would that be acceptable?Have you seen such examples of systemic corruption before? Or is this the only one? Of course to answer that you would also have to answer; can you say in all honesty that you think Ruslik did not lie in this ANI? If you choose not to answer... is it because you believe it is the moral thing to do, or because of possible intimidation or repercussions on your good self?   "	0|0|0|0|0|0

" Please delete user/disc pages; warn jayron/redpen/mufka Hello stephen,If you could please delete my page and page history, I'd be much obliged.I requested speedy deletion on 1Apr for reason 1.6. jayron deleted it, then acted  as if s/he did me a favour. I feel jayron shouldnt have been the one to delete it initially as s/he  and I have negatively interacted in the past. Followups from jayron included an unneccesary block; followed by telling me to get a yahoo email so that I may contact wiki admins! Wiki is all about anon editing  as such I didnt and wont get an email account in order to communicate as it is not required.Since then jayron,redpen, mufka have been repeatedly editing my page. I blank my page they restore it. This has been happening since April, so for 3months now.  I bet if I changed their pages they'd posting threats of  ""i'll report you"" and/or ""you will be banned"". It is quite easy for me to get a new ip address but I dont think Ive done anything wrong, so  I wont change my ip address. If my pages needed to be restored /reverted, I definitely think those three arent the ones who should do it as they/I have  a convoluted history.If you could please delete my page and page history, I'd be much obliged.If you could contact jayron, redpen, & mufka & ask that any problems they have they let an admin or arbitrator know, instread of making changes or posting to me.I'd like to edit wiki in peace Thanks. 173.79.58.33  "	0|0|0|0|0|0

I'm not sure, but as much I do remember, Hague ruled this, declaring Poland as aggressor in Vilnius case. To make sure I'll need to check my books. Lithuanian government did understand, that after the coup there was small possibility, that Poland would use the coup to justify aggression against Lithuania. It seems Pilsudski did also understand that as a possibility. In his diaries there is a record from 1927: ""could  not sleep all night, considered whether to attack Lithuania"".

"New Louisville definitionSince the Census Bureau has clearly defined the new Louisville as only the old city and unincorporated areas, I think there some details needed that need to be added defining Metro Government. First, it is important  to note that a KY Legislative bill (dubbed the Lyndon Bill} prohibits suburban cities from annexing more land. If this were not the case then the unincorp. areas could create their own government and only the old city would again be left.  Second, this definition won't effect the new city's population growth, since nearly all growth is in the unicorpirated areas and nearly all suburban cities are having very slow growth or even populatiuon losses. Third, even if Suburban cities don't count toward the population, their residents can still vote for Metro mayor and council members, and will still receive Metrowide help in such areas as urban planning and emergency services.Personally, I think the official municipality (the entire county) is what should make up this article, regardless of what the Census Bureau says. The smaller article with the ""balance"" is what should have the information for the census-defined city.  Your ideas of what the census bureau has defined are not correct. What you are referring to is the Louisville-Jefferson County balance, which is not the same thing as consolidated Louisville-Jefferson County. Both are defined separately by the Census Bureau (see here). This article is about the consolidated Louisville-Jefferson County (which is how the city is legally incorporated). The confusion lies in the Census Bureau's use of balance figures when ranking cities, rather than the consolidated figures. (Although even this use is inconsistant as they seem to use the full consolidated figures for the decennial rankings.)  The Census Bureau has accepted the Louisville/ Jefferson balance, but not the City/County Consolidation, which is why the suburban populations are not counted in its estimates and won't be in future censuses. Because of the acceptence of the Lou/Jef Balance, my points should be brought up about the ban on suburban city annexation. If this were not the case then the Balance could be quickly eaten up by the suburbs.Your assertion is not entirely correct. The Census Bureau does, in fact, include the entire consolidated Louisville-Jefferson County in their estimates. They also include a separate figure for the balance: 170,Louisville/Jefferson County,Kentucky,A,693604,693872,694757,695843,698059,698903,699827 162,Louisville/Jefferson County (balance),Kentucky,A,551183,551390,552058,552828,554381,555366,556429That's from the 2005 estimates (the last number is the 2005 estimated population). This article is not about the balance, however. Issues involving the balance should be discussed on the balance article's talk page.   Actual Population There are too many disputes about the population of the actual city proper. According to the Census bureau estimates, the balance population is 556,429 and not anywhere near 700,000. What is the actual city proper population, as that is to be what is listed? I do not believe that Louisville has a population anywhere near that of Columbus, Ohio. We need to decide the official population of the city proper and correct any and all inaccurate statements regarding the actual population. There are several pages in Wikipedia listing the population as 699,000 (or so), when the Census lists the population as 556,429. I understand that several people (especially those who live in the area) want the population figure to be high so the city can reach a higher status. If it was a city I lived in, I would like to do the same. However, that cannot be done here. An actual, correct population for the city proper and the metro needs to be listed. If we are able to, we need to come up with the balance population of the counties and the actual city. I am a little confused myself, and I did not want to attempt to change anything before it is discussed.  There have been many people who have debated this over and over again and we have come to the consensus that is now demonstrated in the article.  Please, for the sake of your own knowledge, read all the talk archives that cover this situation.  Since there is a consensus that's currently overwhelmingly not in your favor, you might want to do that research before thinking about flaming things up. — [[User:Stevietheman|	0|0|0|0|0|0

However, redirects from common misspellings or misnomers are generally useful, as are redirects in other languages.""This says ""redirects in other languages are generally useful"" 70.51.8.75  Hi there, this is a difficult one & I can see both sides of the coin. I've tried to see if there is a consensus by looking through Category:Redirects from alternative languages but I'm still not sure. I have always read the ""redirect from another language as being more related to things such as Kyiv (topical one that one - read the talk page! - but I digress), or Das Wohltemperirte Clavier rather than a literal transalation of every article's name in to other languages, particulary those with non-Latin character sets.  This is why I feel that the two (Mandarin?) words/phrases you have mentioned equally fall in to the territory of unlikely/implausible phrases for a person to type on the English language Wikipedia. But the bottom line is that I am one admin & one opinion (which is a valid opinion but equally is far from unchallengable). The redirects were speedily deleted so as there was no deletion discussion there is no community consensus for their deletion which means that you are free to recreate. If they are renominated for deletion I will recuse myself from the process and we'll see what others think. Sound OK to you? Kind regards,  talk Well, there's the essay Wikipedia:Redirects for discussion/Redirects from foreign languages . The article's name is a phonetic and literal translation of the actual name. (ie. It's a chinese spacesuit, the actual name is in chinese, not English).  From the bit about non-Latin characters, doesn't that indicate bias, since English is used in Hong Kong as an official language, where Chinese characters are prevalent, or India, where non-Latin script is common and English is widely used.

"The PIRA campaign that we are talking about started in 1969, a few years before ""Bloody Sunday"", so you can hardly say it ""started the whole affair in motion"" - actually I think the ""whole affair"" was started ""in motion"" hundreds of years ago... Anyway, this article is not about the British Army, it's about the PIRA, so we need to stick to their ""contribution"" to the death / injury count. And as I've said elsewhere, the PIRA have achieved very little else in the past 40 odd years, than kill and maim a lot of people. In ever repects (by their own published aims), they have failed.

I am not a lawyer and I am not interested in becoming one just so I can post on Wikipedia, so I am not going to spend any more time building up a case. It is my understanding that Wikipedia administrators have an active interest in enforcing the rules and not depend on self-appointed legal deputies to do their work for them.There's positive evidence that I am not the same person as these two, so I see no reason why I should pretend to have the burden of proof in this matter.  Based on this, I feel sufficient cause for the removal of all claims of sock-puppetry.

De jure simply means 'in law'; literally 'regarding law'. According to law, the Queen is Head of State in the Commonwealth realms and in the United Kingdom. De facto means 'in fact', that is, 'for all practical purposes', but not accordingly to law. A de facto head of state would be one who governs practically but without due process of law, such as the leader of a coup or a usurper. Even when a country is presided over by a person acting as a regent, such as the Prince Regent George who became George IV, or a Governor-General in the Commonwealth Realms, the reigning Sovereign remains de jure Head of State. Please let us not resurrect the awful discussion about who is Elizabeth really Queen of. It took up pages and created a lot of heat and bad feeling.	0|0|0|0|0|0
a copyright violation is blocked (yes, this has happened), but the current situation of wishy-washy enforcement results in more people being able to get away with editwarring (if they are ‘right’) and more people being blocked (because they are ‘wrong’).Some have criticised the same thing happening in arbitration cases. Those that wheel war on the side of ‘good’ are congratulated or at worst ignored while those on the ‘wrong’ side are desysoped.Both applying things strictly and arbitrarily have their pros and cons. On one side you have have idiotic decisions and on the other there is dissent from those that view various interpretations as unfair, uneven, or incorrect. As the community grows and changes, what works best may change. What works best for a small business or a city council may not be the best for a Fortune 500 company or a national legislature. Needs serious reform // December 8, 2007 at 3:44 am Wikipedia used to promote fascist propagandaGADGETS GAMES AT HOME BIZTECH SECURITY CONNECTIVITY TECHTIPS IT JOBSWikipedia sued for ‘aiding neo-Nazis’December 7, 2007 - 11:14AMA left-wing German politician has filed charges against online encyclopaedia Wikipedia for promoting the use of banned Nazi symbols in Germany.Katina Schubert, a deputy leader of the Left party, said she had filed the charge with Berlin police on the grounds that Wikipedia’s German language site contained too much Nazi symbolism, particularly an article on the Hitler Youth movement.“The extent and frequency of the symbols on it goes beyond what is needed for documentation and political education, in my view,” she told Reuters. “This isn’t about restricting freedom of opinion, it’s about examining what the limits are.”Schubert said she had taken legal advice before making her move, and that she hoped it would encourage public debate on how far internet platforms should be allowed to aid proponents of extremist, anti-semitic and racist ideologies.“There are signs neo-Nazis are trying to take advantage of such structures, and this needs to be stopped in good time,” Schubert said. “Especially given that Wikipedia is too important to jeopardise as an open and self-regulating project.”A spokesman for Wikimedia Deutschland, an organisation that promotes the internet lexicon in Germany, rejected the charge.“We don’t really know what Ms Schubert’s problem is,” Arne Klempert, managing director of Wikimedia Deutschland, told Reuters. “What’s important is the context the symbols are used in, and here it’s quite clearly education and documentation.”“Anyone who tries to prevent the Nazi period being documented properly has a strange understanding of the world, in my view,” Klempert said. “Because that’s the best weapon there is (to prevent) something like that from happening again.”Public display of Nazi symbols is illegal in Germany, but they can be used for educational and artistic purposes.Schubert also came under fire from party colleagues.“Katina Schubert fails to grasp the self-regulating mechanisms that work in Wikipedia,” Heiko Hilker, a Left party media expert in Saxony’s state parliament, said in a statement.“Right-wing extremism on the World Wide Web cannot be tackled via national criminal proceedings,” he added.Schubert said police would pass on the charge to state prosecutors, who would decide whether to open an investigation.Klempert said Wikipedia’s structure, which enables internet users to discuss and edit content, ensured no bias arose. “Particularly on subjects like the Hitler Youth, you can be sure it would be changed in seconds if it did (show bias),” he said.The Hitler Youth was the Nazis’ official youth organisation.Reuters	0|0|0|0|0|0

" suggestions to improve readability Hi guys, the page seems very fragmented and is difficult to read, at least thats what I read in the 24 reader comments. (i inserted public ledger in the first sentence because it was missing). before delving into the supertechnical aspect of how bitcoins are generated and frustrate readers, i d start from the spot that everybody understands about money: explain the intent of the system (missing right now). sthg like:  ""it was created to exchange money electronically and securely without a third party, that can dictate credit worthiness or  price of transactions as in banks or PayPal etc.then move on to basics. keep the bitcoin protocol details out of the article since you already split off the page about the protocol. the shortest description Ive read is: ""When a transaction is broadcast to the network, it is relayed with a digital fingerprint that identifies it. Bitcoin miners scoop it up, verify it, and send it on to the rest of the network for confirmation. Once the transaction has been confirmed, there is no way for that same person to spend those same bitcoins because they are being checked against the public ledger."" by Morgen Peck in IEEE spectrum Feb 13, 14 a short and successful article explaining bitcoins is here. another FAQ from a Washington Post blog is here and an article 3 days ago about the death of the Mt. Gox Bitcoin Exchange by Morgen Peck (was on Science Friday today) is hereBitcoin was also discussed On Point last November in conjunction with the Senate committee hearing about it.    "	0|0|0|0|0|0

"Yeah, they really exist. You need at least one w-3 (one FA from that class) and one w-6 (one from that class) and you can make the others from them (a few carnivores species need more). Essential fatty acid deficiency was first seen in people getting total intravenous nutrition, where, for obvious reasons they put in only amino acids, sugar, vitamins and minerals (fat emulsions were quite hard to develop as IV formulas). The reason for the problem is that the body can make facts but cannot introduce unsaturation closer to the end than w-9, and you NEED w-6 and w-3 fatty acids to make lipids (the w-3 DHA is your most common neural tissue fat).  I'll see what I can do to put in some general refs from academic nutrition books. There is some quackery out there (like pills that contain w-9 because olive oil is cheap) but most of the fish oil supplements are worth taking, actually, unless you eat cold water ocean fish regularly.  BTW, there is some evidence that that bad reputation of saturated fats are from experiments in which animals were fed only hydrogenated coconut oil for their fat source. This destroys all essential fatty acids because it destroys all PUFAs. On such a diet, even DOGS get severe atherosclerosis, and they are species highly resistant to it (their HDLs are higher than their LDLs). So all this is quite fascinating.  "	0|0|0|0|0|0

"Comment: The term ""Eastern Kentucky Coal Field"", as seen in those references, is used in discussing the geology of the region. In contrast, this article is about this region of Kentucky as a whole, not just about its geology or the occurrence of coal. Accordingly, I think the article name needs to include the word ""region"" for clarity. However, the singular ""Coal Field"" might be more appropriate than the plural. The comments placed on this page in 2006 suggested ""Cumberland Plateau""; that name and ""Allegheny Plateau"" are both widely recognized physiographic terms, but neither of these terms is specific to Kentucky (see the articles on Cumberland Plateau and Allegheny Plateau).

People read to retain information the right set up enhances that . Too many pictures are a distraction . They take away from the knowledge . More fleshed out sections can help . Ill brainstorm on that until later . I guess add the picture, if it bumps the others too far out of whack we can resize it or when the story gets fleshed out a little, maybe it will balance itself out more. The third option is we can fill out some sections more . Make it more balanced and then add the zines' photo, after, so it Accentuates and isn't the meat and potatoes of the section .  the sections of ""influence on other genres"" .

Good Information!  Going for the most accurate and complete encyclopedic content possible, should we then create a different article for the Gong Baotian and Xie Pieqi styles?  Rather than dilute the style information of each style, my thought is that we should have a separate article for each subsystem that varies significantly from the norm.  Perhaps one called 'Xie Pieqi Line Yin Style Baguazhang' and another 'Gong Baotian Line Yin Style Baguazhang'.  For each style with significant amounts of content as well as verifiable sources, splits from the main article seem to make sense to me.	0|0|0|0|0|0
Molly Ivins talks about the Republican's desire to eliminate social security in this article, amognst others:http://www.workingforchange.com/article.cfm?itemid=18336Also, House member Brown speaks of it here:http://www.house.gov/corrinebrown/ccorner107/corner.socialsecurity.htmlAnd plenty of libertarians in the country actively advocate the elimination of social security.http://www.isil.org/resources/lit/time-to-end-ss.htmlI realize that the segment on eliminating the 6.2% employer tax is something less frequently commented on and probably should not have been included, but I think discussion of possible elimination of the program is important/worthwhile. 19:41, Jan 27, 2005 (UTC)	0|0|0|0|0|0

":::SLR Chronology bibliography is completeHi, MurderWatcher1. This is Paul1513 again. This is to let you know that I have completed the SLR Chronology bibliography for you and that I am going to try to upload  a PDF copy to your Talk page as soon as I finish this note. This may take a while, because I've never uploaded a PDF before.You're absolutely right; it would be great if some of the old Modern Photography stuff could be added to Wikipedia. However, you can be sure that they're still under copyright. (Pre-1978 American ""work-for-hire"" copyrights are generally 75 years; 1978 and on, 95 years.) The real question is: Who OWNS the copyright today? Since Modern went under, there have been many media company sales and resales - the present copyright holder would be hell to uncover and ask permission. In fact, the current owner might not even know that it owns Modern's copyrights. ""Orphaned"" copyrights are a major unresolved ""fair use"" issue in the information age.Speaking of first cameras: mine was a simple Vivitar 110 point-and-shoot. My parents gave it to me for getting straight A's  in the 5th grade. It was, of course, a bad camera, but it opened up a world of possibilities. From the Vivitar, I eventually learned about the existence of the Pentax Auto 110 SLR. It was then one step to 35 mm SLRs and I got a Nikon FE2 in 1983. The FE2 is also the reason why the bulk of my Modern Photography magazine citations begin around 1983.I'm sorry to hear about your disputes with the Admins over your non-photography Wkipedia entries. It would be unfortunate if you felt compelled to end your Wikipedia activities over them. Perhaps you could start a blog or create a MySpace or Facebook page to air these issues without worrying about what the Admins want.

"The titles need not show that the characters are related, all about this is in the articles. You see, the nature of fiction is that it's not necessarily coherent. Since this article is not about Malcolm Wilkerson in the first episode of the show ""Malcolm in the Middle"" but about the character throughout the show, it is indeed inaccurate to use a name for the character that was only used for the pilot episode. For the entire rest of the seven season run, the character's name was only ""Malcolm"". This is not a question of beauty or taste, but of plain accuracy. A title like ""Malcolm (XXX)"" my appear clumsy, but Wilkerson is not an alternative. In my opinion. If can't build consensus on this between the two of us, I suggest asking for additional input at Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions, since I didn't find anything in the guidelines for a specific case like this (although I'm fairly sure the fact that the character's name was ""Wilkerson"" only during the first of 151 episodes of the show means that calling the character ""Wilkerson"", esp. in the title, is inaccurate). —'''''' "	0|0|0|0|0|0
I just read something interesting. Apparently there have never been a minority living in this village. This village was always populated with only Bulgarians. Not Albanians or any other. Also when the mosque was build in Razgrad there was material taken from this village.

Relevance? 'In a New Zealand TV2 series presented by Rebecca Gibney called Sensing Murder, which aired on TVNZ beginning in 2006, three psychic mediums from Australia and New Zealand, Sue Nicholson, Kelvin Cruickshank and Deb Webber, armed only with photographs of the victims of unsolved murders, and purportedly no prior knowledge of the cases, attempted to help police detectives and a team of investigators by communicating with the spirits of the victims to uncover details of their life and death. The team of investigators followed up the psychics’ leads and apparently came up with information about the killers and whereabouts of victims' remains.[27] Skepticism regarding the series has come from several sources,[28][29][30] and it was further satirized in the season finale, where host Jeremy Wells humorously highlighted the fact that not a single case had been solved.[31]'Just how relevant is this? Granted, it does provide criticism, yet it is from a television show. We are given no knowledge of the reputation or fame of these mediums, so it is difficult to criticise all based on a few. If high profile mediums were used, I would have been inclined to agree on the inclusion.Whilst the rest of the criticism section is valid and comes from scientists etc, the validity of a statement by a television presenter is small, and it is difficult to see any real reason for the inclusion other than to bolster the criticism section.Cheers,	0|0|0|0|0|0

Howard was the highest taxing govt in Australia's history, Labor then reduced the income tax rate three times since, all he did in terms of economic reform was a GST. He preferred to play the social conservative while pretending that everything we have around us, markets, the general direction of IR, taxation, etc etc, is a product of Labor which the conservative have always tried to claim the later credit for. Oh, and in modern times, slash and burn health/education/social/etc services to bring the budget back in to the black. Even though Menzies never had a budget surplus.

If we are obsessive about this kind of thing, wikipedia will never grow, and it is completely counterproductive to revert unsourced statements of what is essentially common knowledge.

" stop talking nonsense there is no such thing as ""Mongolia (region)"". Mongolia has been a country throughout the history inhabitted by mainly Mongols along with others but never Chinese until recent. The country has been divided in recent history into several pieces due to: 1. Manchu invasion; 2. Russian expansion and Chinese imperialism; 3. Spread of communism.Not only the term and concept of ""Mongolia (region)"" are fabricated, this article here along with the ""Inner Mongolia"" article (especially the ""history"" part) are largely Communist Chinese government. Those who, I believe they are Chinese, if not government agent, should immediately stop doing this and the Wikipedia management should take some actions to stop this chauvinistic plots."	0|0|0|0|0|0

Stalinácio Lula da Silva, by your signature we can tell how biased you are and the reason why you'd want to add defamatory material to Rousseff's article. Well, it ain't going happen. Here are the facts: Charles Chandler was in Brazil to help train the DOI-CODI and DOPS torturers. For this reason he was gunned down by the VPR militant group in 1968. Rousseff was never a member of the VPR. At that time - 1968 - she was a member of another organization called COLINA. She would later join VAR Palmares in 1969. Therefore, there are absolutely no links, whatsoever, between Rousseff and the assassination of Charles Chandler.	0|0|0|0|0|0

I get tired also. It is tiresome when any deragator remark is made on behalf of any religion.  As was stated before i work in an office of a huge corporation.  What address you are talking about i have no idea.  As stated before over and over again: I   DID   NOT  TYPE THOSE REMARKS. I   DID   NOT  REVERT THEM BACK IN.  Each religion, nationality ect. deserves respect.  the only only thing i did with in the last couple of days was to bold highlight in the critisim of Jehovahs witnesses. the part i highlighted was the paragraph on Witnesses reporting child molestation as by law.  i did that because some seems to believe that witnesses dont report perverts and we do. it is the law and those sickos should be persequted.  Sir I did not and i repeat did not type that other mess. nor did i revert. i dont even know when i showed up. all i know is that this morning i was blocked again. i thought i was about the highlighted paragraph.  I   DID    NOT    TYPE   THAT   OTHER    MESS NOR    DID    I   REVERT IT.  NO religion should be subjected to that kind of bullying.	0|0|0|0|0|0

"==Etymology==This etymological discussion is simply wrong in so many ways:The Greek name tigris comes from the Old Persian word for ""tiger"" and means ""the fast one"". It might also be argued to come from Kurdish too. In Kurdish ""Tir"" means arrow. This means that the river is quick and fast like an arrow.Tîj-Tûj means sharp, pointing and cutting. Since the letter ""j"" doesn't exist in Greek Tîj-Tûj became Tig later Tigr.In Greek at the end of words -is sonex is used (Tîj-Tijr-Tig-Tigr-Tigris). First of all, the Persian for ""tiger"" is babr, not tigr or anything like it.  The Greek word ""tigris"" meaning ""tiger"" may be related to Persian words within the same family as ""*tigr"", but that is not the Persian meaning of the words.Second, the Kurdish (and Farsi) word for ""arrow"", tir, comes from Middle Persian tigr  which also means ""arrow"".Third, the word tij (or rather tiz) ""sharp"" is certainly related to tigr, but they belong to the same word family  they are not the same word.I'll try to come up with something better."	0|0|0|0|0|0

GroupingKhoikhoi has been adding this  TABThe Turks of Turkey can be broken down into a variety of segments and the majority of self-identifying Turks include four main groupings: Rumelian Turks who are mostly of Balkan origin, Anatolian Turks who compose the bulk of ethnic Turks found in Anatolia, (see history section) Central Asian Turks who remain a large segment of the population that has been moving to Turkey for centuries, and Eurasian Turks from Russia and the Caucasus such as the Tatars and Azerbaijanis who have more recent ties with Turkic peoples. These Turks share similar languages and cultures.which is not true because according to it, the large segment of the population should be from central asia but its not true. They should be included in the Anatolian Turks because noone in Turkey has recent ties with Central asia other than Tatars,etc.., which are already explained below as Eurasian Turks. So it makes 3 groupings.	0|0|0|0|0|0

Atheism My main concern is that the article spends too much time discussing what it isn't, primarily in relation to christianity, and not what it IS.

I disagree that vowel harmony is the place to discuss i-mutation in Welsh. I see no reason why this article, or umlaut and a-mutation for that matter, should be restricted to Germanic. I think this article should be about any fronting/raising process triggered by a following high front vocoid, regardless of what language it's attested in. Likewise a-mutation shouldn't be restricted to Germanic but should include lowering caused by a following /a/ in other languages as well (again an example from Welsh: gwyn 'white (masc.)' < *windos vs. gwen 'white (fem.)' < *windā). Umlaut should mostly be about the written sign, with an indication that it also the name for processes like i-mutation and a-mutation. Vowel harmony should be about the left-to-right processes typical of Uralic and Altaic languages. That's what I think. /comhrá	0|0|0|0|0|0

"I see that this debate has in any case been pre-empted by User:Kotniski who has created and populated the "":Category:Constituent countries of the United Kingdom"". In my opinion this is unacceptable as 1) the debate is still in progress, indeed it has barely begun, and2) the new category name has the rejected term ""constituent countries"" and is therefore contrary to a decision reached after a long discussion and contradicts the main article's name (Countries of the United Kingdom) and the term found in most other relevant articles. Personally, I don't see why Wales et al should not be categoried as 'European countries'. I am certainly against this unilateral reversion to a contentious and rarely used term that has been rejected here. This new category is not acceptable and a consensus decision would also be needed for the proper and logical alternative, i.e. 'Countries of the United Kingdom', if the need for it is proven and accepted.

The Dominion of Canada was no more self-governing in 1867 than Nova Scotia had been in 1866. See quotes in article from Heard. Canadian independence was not granted by titles, it was taken by Parliamentary action. This was certainly the case by 1907. That's why NZ and NF wanted to be known as dominions too. It had nothing to do with the naming of the country in 1867, though.	0|0|0|0|0|0

===Belated Merry Christmas and Hello from N.Srinivasan: a few submissions on contradictions in Indian History pages: Thanks for your affirmative action in unlocking history pages:=Dear Tiptoety,I request you to have a careful look at the pages of history edited by User Dinesh Kannambadi who while claiming to source material from ‘reliable’ sources, is at the same time indulging in feeding of completely unverified and unreliable pieces of information.This communication from me may kindly be regarded by you as one among a series of interactions with you with my sole aim being the betterment of history pages of Wikipedia and nothing else. It has been my experience while trying to contribute to history pages or indeed indulge in discussions for betterment of Wikipedia pages, whatever we do users like Dinesh Kannambadi have objected to always and have branded our contributions as vandalism and sourcing from POV websites etc.  Just take note of the contradictory nature of his editing of history pages especially on the Chalukya Empires especially with reference to the Chola Empire (pls. also remember that in Wikipedia for God knows what reason, the pages on the Chola Empire have been christened as Chola Dynasty despite that the fact that the Cholas prospered at the helm of an empire having large territories not just in India but also overseas including Sri Lanka, Maldives, very large parts of South East Asia for at least 150 years of their existence.  Here are the examples: but before that I would like to say this that deliberately, user Dinesh Kannambadi has been trying to mention or project the Chalukya dynasty as some sort of a contemporary of the Chola empire and has even gone on to mention the demise of the Chola empire (saying that the Chola territories were taken over by the Pandiyas), which has a great weakness:  the Chalukya dynasty had very weak kings from 1126 onwards and between 1135/1140 to 1175 their kings were displaced and the Kalachuris under Bijjala I and Bijjala II ruled Kannada country in India.  The Chalukyas did make a comeback but that was for just 10-15 years between 1185 to 1198 after which they went into oblivion.  I request  that you may kindly contrast this with the fate of the Cholas, whose kings from AD 1170 though were not as strong as their kings between AD 848-1165, yet one of their last great kings Kulothunga III on the strength of epigraphical and inscriptional evidence is said to have occupied Madurai, Karur and Sri Lanka (then known as Ilangai) between 1185-1200 AD.  He ruled for around 45 years though near the end of his rule he was indeed routed by the Pandiyans and held on to his empire with great difficulty, having Hoysalas as his allies.  Yet, even with weak kings following him after 1218, the Cholas lasted till 1279, when their last king lost to the Pandiyas and the Cholas went into oblivion.  Contrast the above i.e. the demise of the Cholas in 1279 or 1280 to that of the Chalukyas, who were first of all without a capital for over 35 years and re-emerged for just 10-15 years and became history by AD 1195 or thereabouts.  Yet, jingoism seems to get the better of user Dinesh Kannambadi and he has written in the Western Chalukya Empire page as under:  the link is http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Chalukyas and the relevant portion of text is the following:“This period saw the fall of two great empires, the Chalukyas of the western deccan and the Cholas of Tamilakam. On the ruins of these two empires were built the Kingdoms of their feudatories whose mutual antagonisms filled the annals of Deccan history for over a hundred years, the Pandyas taking control over some regions of the erstwhile Chola empire.”Though (technically speaking at least) as per the version of Dinesh Kannambadi, the Chalukyas fell and demised in 1191/1195 and the Cholas demised after almost 9 decades in about 1279/80…. i.e. within a hundred years of each other… I would like to raise the question what is the justification for his expression …”This period saw the fall of two great empires…”  I mean what is meant by “this period” surely if both empires had fallen within two or three decades of each other, then the expression could be a little contemporaneous… but even as a weak empire the Cholas lasted till 1280 almost 84 years after the Chalukyas demised.. then what is the reason and justification for mentioning the demise of the Cholas when the subject on the page i.e. the Chalukya dynasty, which went into oblivion in the year 1191 or 1195???? The point is that whether it is mentioning the Hoysalas another Kannada empire or the Chalukyas, he is obsessed with their portrayals as some sort of contemporaries of the Cholas.. even while mentioning Chalukya architecture, user Dinesh Kannambadi cannot resist bringing in the Cholas;;; see this write u	0|0|0|0|0|0
" Locations Thailand.While Phuket is a more popular and well known general tourist location in Thailand that includes sex tourism.  Pattaya is clearly a location that is dedicated almost exclusively to sex tourism.  I dont know Phuket that well but well enough it is bigger but probably has alot more non-sex tourists so if I were going to identify a place in Thailand if not the world I would mention Pattaya instead and I am tempted to edit.  I hazard a good guess that on any day there is much more ""sex for money"" going on in Pattaya than Phuket. But for someone considering the phrase ""sex tourism"" as not necessarily pejorative I have to qualify this conclusion.  Note that ""bar girls"" in Thailand never refer to themselves as prostitutes and this probably goes for most of the general Thai population also.  Although I beleive that there are words in Thai for prostitute they mostly (at least the girls) prefer to call themselves ""rented wifes"" albeit for ""short time"" rather then ""long time"".  I therefore need to be qualify my Pattaya versus Phuket statistic in order to be accurate as excluding sex between husbands and  rented wifes particularly of the ""long-term"" married western kind that typically eventually end up with a large exchange of capital in the ""wifes"" direction whether during the marriage or at its end or both.  There is no such thing as a free lunch and ""everybody pays for it"". [Note that I neither intend nor consider any of the former comments to be either sexist (note women still get paid less than men and suffer loss of income during pregnancy and child rearing) and moreover consider them culturally aware (particurlay Thailand wise).  The fact is that almost all relationships of a sexual kind are commercial ones! One must be aware that labels, concepts, ideas such as ""sex tourism"" carry suggestions associated with Religion particularly Judeo-Christiam-Islamic (JDI) pejoratives thst underpin much of western if not most of the (Religious) worlds worldviews outside of some tribal, village, usually Buddhist and what I like to call ""Giesha cultures"": e.g. Japan, Thailand etc, versus ""Virgin cultures"" typically (JDI) that often revolve around even int he west to some extend the worhship and praise of female virginity before marriage. (Note that Thai Society is strangely contradictory in this regard  aren't we all!  but then Thai culture too has a long and more recent tradition of polygamy than the west.)  Perhaps some historio-religious criticism of these sorts o pejorative and cultural factors should be entertained in the article proper also.  I hate value laden western (and Religious) labels that dress themselves up psuedo-scientificly as culturally universal. Exploitation of the child aside their is vastly more ""exploitation"" going on outside of the sex busniess in the third world under global capitalism like Chinese factories where labourers - girls included - work excruciating long hours for a few Yuan or RMB.] "	0|0|0|0|0|0

That is interesting about Batman, I think it gets away with it because it was promoted in 2003, before the major FU crackdown. The issue with fair use vs free images I see is that if there was the possibility of finding free images then we wouldn't be able to use any fair use images (they would be deemed replacable) what kind of free images were you thinking of? The only thing I could think of is if we could find a free image of the panel at comic-con showing the cast/crew. That seems like a good addition to the article.

"To Cool Hand Luke: I ask for your help as an administrator with this problem. From the Wikipedia deletion guidelines:Deletion process    Main article: Wikipedia:Deletion policyDeletion of articles from Wikipedia occurs through one of three processes.     2. Another quick method is the use of proposed deletion: simply add  to the top of the article. This is meant for articles where the deletion is believed to be uncontroversial, yet does not meet the criteria for speedy deletion. A proposed deletion can be contested by any user by removing the  tag within five days, and if anyone still wants the article deleted the full AFD process is required.I thought I complied with this policy, it seems to say that ""any user"" can ""contest"" the proposal by ""removing"" the tag. It seems obvious that this article easily meets the criteria for notabilitythe stated reason for deletion. Beyond meeting the criteria's specifics, the criteria also has a catchall inclusion rule that the mere fact that an article does not meet specific criteria is not a sufficient reason to delete it.I believe that the proposal to delete this article was made in retaliation against me personally and was not made in good faith to further the goals of Wikipedia, and that the proposal to delete, along with the reasons given, which I believe are not in good faith, therefore violates various Wikipedia policies.The evidence for this belief includes (1) the proximity in time to an unrelated disagreement with the user proposing deletion; (2) the user's prior lack of interest or contribution or current knowledge of (as demonstrated by his reasons or comments) to the subject of the article proposed for deletion; (3) the fact that I have worked on this article in the past; (4) the fact that this user on or about the same day and time, in close proximity to the unrelated dispute with me, proposed two other articles that I have worked on that the user also has not previously or currently demonstrated any knowledge of or interest in; (5) proposed such articles for speedy deletion and then before I or anyone else had a chance to object (Wikipedia is not a full time job for most users, who only visit the site from time to time, and note also the stated policy that there are ""no emergencies on Wikipedia,"" the user decided not to wait for any objections or to follow the policy of allowing the stated time period to pass, redirected the article to another article, effectively deleting the original article. In fact the redirect was effect as I was typing out an objection to the deletion with a reasoned explanation on why it should stay, and when I hit save, the article was gone and my objection and response are now lost; (6) he gave me three rapid succession warnings (in bad faith, for what I believe were good faith acts on my part) and had me blocked before I could make a response to his ""warnings""; it appears that he has dome similar things in the past to other users.It seems quite clear in light of the above, and further facts that can be marshalled in support, that this user's intent is (1) not supported by facts or policies, (2) not in good faith, (3) in retaliation, and therefore (5) in violation of Wikipedia policy.Recognizing this, I communicated to this user that I would refrain from any activity that was the subject of the origial unrelated disagreement, by not making any further comment on the talk page of Tort Reform. I had hoped that this would resolve that dispute but it has not, as the user had made the dispute personal.As for my being blocked by you as per the 3-revert rule, I must point out that I do not believe the rule applies to what I did, because I was (1) making a good faith effort to resolve the dispute by asking the user to stop his vandalism and disruption, (2) the posts involved were all on his talk pagethe most appropriate place to discuss a user's (his) apparent violations; (3) rather than reply, he deleted the warnings and requests to stop; (4) did so more than three times, in violation of the rule; (5) in bad faith, turned the rule on meI did not delete anything, and technically, I did not revert anything either, I think, but was adding to previous posts, and merely included the previously deleted material as support for a NEW post.Other indications of bad faith:The user asserts that I committed ""vandalism"" to the entry on Sonic's Rendezvous Band by removing the delete tags. My reply is (1) I did so in accordance with policy; (2) it is not ""vandalism"" to remove	0|0|0|0|0|0

You currently appear to be engaged in an edit war. Note that the three-revert rule prohibits making more than three reversions in a content dispute within a 24 hour period. Additionally, users who perform a large number of reversions in content disputes may be blocked for edit warring, even if they do not technically violate the three-revert rule. If you continue, you may be blocked from editing. Please do not repeatedly revert edits, but use the talk page to work towards wording and content which gains a consensus among editors.  If you revert the edits by Skeeker or any other user that provide citations you will be reported and blocked. Consensus has been reached on the Children of Bodom talk page regarding Children of Bodom's genre and it would be wise if you would visit the page. Also please don't attack other users as you did to Skeeker on your revert summary, if you continue you can be blocked for this as well.	0|0|0|0|0|0
Hello, Zwack GB, and welcome to Wikipedia! Thank you for your contributions.I notice that one of the first articles you edited  appears to be dealing with a topic with which you may have a conflict of interest. In other words, you may find it difficult to write about that topic in a neutral and objective way, because you are, work for, or represent, the subject of that article. Your recent contributions may have already been reverted for this very reason. To reduce the chances of deletion, you might like to draft your article before submission, then ask me or any other editor to proofread it. To start creating a draft article, just click your user name at the top of the screen when you are logged in, and edit that page as you would any other. If the page you created has already been deleted from Wikipedia, but you want to save the content from it to use for that draft, don't hesitate to ask anyone from this list and they will copy it to your user page.The one firm rule we do have in connection with conflicts of interest is that accounts used by more than one person will unfortunately be blocked from editing. It is also worth noting that Wikipedia generally does not allow editors to have usernames which specifically link them to one company or corporation. If your username does have such a name, it would be advisable for you to request a change of username.If you are stuck, and looking for help, please come to the New contributors' help page, where experienced Wikipedians can answer any queries you have! You can also just type  on your user page, and someone will show up shortly to answer your questions.

" Answer to Osli73 Those with leftist agenda cannot be considered neutral observers due to their denial of genocide and open one-sidedness with Serbs and/or Milosevic, see Znet resource for example. When you mention ""Bosniak sources"", who are you referring to? Do you consider the International Tribunal a ""Bosniak source""? Srebrenica massacre is heavily based on Internationa Tribunal's rulling (e.g. Radislav Krstic judgement), and you are trying to destroy the article by inserting revisionist 'garbage' with the purpose of morally equivating victims with aggressors who committed genocide. The bottom line is: Alternative views do not matter, what matters is cold-harded facts from such sources as International Tribunal, Human Rights Watch, State-sponsored Research & Documentation Centre, International Missing Association (or whatever the official name is) etc. When it comes to editing this article in a ""rational matter"", you are the only one who rejects International Tribunal's version of the article and seeks Serbian (or pro-Serbian) version of the article. As you can see, you are not succeeding and your edits don't stay longer than couple of hours. People will not stand for your version of the article, because this is wikipedia and you cannot force people to accept your opinion and reject already established facts by International Crimes Tribunal for Former Yugoslavia and other neutral credible sources.

"Yes, I do realize a lot of people made contributions to the article when I approached it. This is why I made a lot of effort to get other opinions on the rewrite and what the article should cover. See Talk:Sex#Rewrite of article, Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Sexology and sexuality, Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Biology#Sex, and Wikipedia talk:Version_1.0 Editorial Team/Core topics#Sex. No secret has been made of this rewrite—you can see how difficult it has been to get feedback. This article obviously had no ""steward"", as you so aptly describe on your userpage. I chose to become that steward when I proposed and made the rewrite. I would eventually like to take this core article to FA and it's been difficult to get any feedback.Perhaps you didn't realize it, but a ""see also"" section is deprecated, material should be covered within the body of the article. This came up during the Genetics FAC. I'm sorry your link got removed; I thought I had covered everything in the article.

I'm surprised, hurt, and disappointed that you're so quick to be angry with me. In my past experience (and up to now with the Sex article), I've been too hesitant to throw away old material and too slow to rewrite. Because I got no response to my proposal, and because the article was so poorly written, I went ahead and did it.

"Hi Math. Thanks for the page with the pictures of her art. I find it very interesting. Her pictures of women's bodies as commodities are very disturbing, while her photos of Morrissey are beautiful. I really want to get my hands on the Morrissey Shot book, but I couldn't order it from amazon, apparently they can't ship it to my country.Anyway, I know what you're talking about, information on Linder and Ludus is very hard to find. Besides the Ludus biography you quoted, I've come across a couple of articles about an exhibition she did in 2000: The Guardian article http://film.guardian.co.uk/Feature_Story/feature_story/0,,138286,00.htmland here is a long and in-depth article:http://www.3ammagazine.com/litarchives/nov2001/manchester_voodoo.htmlHer real name is Linda Mulvey. The Guardian article gives info on her date and place of birth (1954, Liverpool) and a bit on her background.I have some pictures from Ludus sleeves that I might include in the article.Besides The Importance of Being Morrissey, Linder also appeared in Southbank Show on The Smiths. What other magazine articles have you found about her? She's usually mentioned in connection with Morrissey, and even that is very rarely. The only magazine article I can think of is that (in)famous Nick Kent ""The Face"" 1985 article on The Smiths. There are also a few pages about her in ""The Severed Alliance"", but it's similar stuff as in that Ludus biography you posted the link to, plus some interesting quotes by Richard Boon and Trotter. Apparently her flat in Whalley Range was sort of a bohemian haven for many musicins and artists. They also claim she had quite an influence over men in her circle, that Pete Shelley wrote Buzzcocks' 'What Do I Get' as a plea of unrequited love for her, and that she inspired a lot of Devoto's early work. Her name also pops up a lot in ""Songs That Saved Your Life"" - besides Cemetry Gates, she's mentioned in entries for Miserable Lie, Wonderful Woman, Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me (in connection to a weird matrix message that was initially supposed to be on the single) and I Won't Share You. In the latter, there's another quote from the unused Morrissey sleeve note for the cancelled Crepuscule Ludus restrospective - the end of the note sounds very familiar: ""Oh Linder. Oh Linder. I'll see you sometime, somewhere."" However, I'm not sure if you should mention any of this stuff in an article, for one thing it comes close to or falls directly into the realm of speculation on personal matters... then again, it's not like Wikipedia articles do not include speculation and rumours (Morrissey page is one of the examples!) But it would be wrong to make it seem as if she is more important for her relationships with male musicians than for her own work... so I don't know.  "	0|0|0|0|0|0

In 1997, Smash Hits debated whether or not to put the boyband Damage on the front cover of an issue of their publication. They felt that, as the band were black, this may mean that they would suffer a loss of sales for that issue. It was mistakenly thought that Smash Hits had never previously had a band with an all black line up on the cover when in fact the likes of Sade, Neneh Cherry and Five Star had featured on the front page.	0|0|0|0|0|0

The othello Error (Ekman, 1985) refers to the Sheakspeare's play of Othello killing his wife who he suspected to love another man. All this based upon his wife's distress failing to listen to her alternative innocent explanations. The interpretation of behaviour. When a subject under questioning show signs of fear and/or distress it could indicate the subject is not telling the truth. The Othello Error refers to the fact that honest people may experience fear during questioning and show signs of fear while perfectly telling the truth. In essence you can not rely entirely on signs of fear as an indicator of truth or lie. You have to look beyond the signs.	0|0|0|0|0|0
"Speedy deletion of Mass (Masud) A tag has been placed on Mass (Masud), requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section G4 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be a repost of material that was previously deleted following a deletion debate, such as at articles for deletion. Under the specified criteria, where an article has substantially identical content to that of an article deleted after debate, and any changes in the content do not address the reasons for which the material was previously deleted, it may be deleted at any time. If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the article (just below the existing speedy deletion or ""db"" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

=The Signature of the Atomic BombThere are good reasons to claim that the catastrophical event of the atomic bombing of Japan, marks the shift to what we here term contemporary in regard of art as defined in the contents page per 27 October 2010, or 19 Dhu al-Qidah 1431, or 19 Heshavan 5771. Butoh may thus be regarded as the epitome of contemporary art. Except from this, it is a problematic definition for a number of reasons. First. Art by artists working both before the World War II, during and after, can not necessarily be defined as more, or less, contemporary because of this timestamp. Contemporary art did explicitly exist also before World War II, as this label - contemporary - has been expressed as a mark of quality, pertaining especially to modernism, by art carrying an ideal summoning, from the artist or his genius, making some kind of composed expression of what, in such case, are to be evaluated or considered the spirit of the time, reflecting or in dialogue with the contemporary world, in the event of the art-making process including its publication or presentation. Another trickster is, for me, that the concept of contemporaneousness also must be regarded in relation to art that specifically deals with contemporarity as it moved through time. It is absurd as a Norwegian to not consider Henrik Ibsen a maker of contemporary art. His plays are distinguished by being contemporary plays and historic plays. I sincerly believe that Henrik Ibsen was intending to make drama that also were to be transformed, or may I say be transported by the unfolding of time. The retrospective style of his contemporary plays is at least a strong indication for that his plays not necessarily should stay in the conformity of the 19th century. I think it is possible to find many other reasons for striking out such a definition of contemporary art as this lexicalisation implies.	0|0|0|0|0|0

We can assume that the Polish communities would form their distinct attitude towards Nazis and partisans anyway, no matter how many years ago Polish state was lost. I believe it's more about ethnicity and religion. However, if you insist on mentioning the partition issue, two thesises need to be stressed in the text:there were territories previously under Polish and under Soviet rulethose territories were multiethnic at the time, not ""Polish""; significantly Belarusian/Ukrainian as wellI'll suggest my text formulation later.

Okay, but the tag is inappropriate because both articles lead off (either in the title or the first few sentences of the article) by noting that there are mosque controversies elsewhere than ground zero.

Ideas, ideas Hey, how's it goin' Ginkgo100? I had a couple ideas I wanted to bounce off another editor to see what they thought: you’re the editor. Here's what’s going on in my head:First; I was looking at the Bill Ritter (politician) article a little while ago and thinking it was a little dull. You scored that good shot of Ritter at the CDC, and that's about all the color we've got. So, I stopped by Ritter's campaign site (http://www.ritterforgovernor.com) and found a great screenshot off KUSA of the latest poll numbers (drop by and take a look if you can). I thought maybe this might be worth uploading (if applicable; didn't check yet) and using in the Ritter article and Colorado gubernatorial election, 2006. What do you think?In a related thought, I stumbled upon the video of the Ritter/Beauprez debates from Aug. 11 (Here's a link ). Other articles I've read have contained video, but this one might be a little to long (any thoughts?) and may not be material appropriate or applicable to upload onto Wikipedia.Second, I'm going to plunge into a clean-up effort that looks a little challenging over at National Western Stock Show (take a look and you'll see what I mean). If you can, and you like what's one of my favorite events in Denver, drop by the article and help me out a little.Thanks for the help; I've written a lot here, my apologies. See ya' around, have a good one.	0|0|0|0|0|0

Is Deepak the ruler of the world? Let me give you people who love this guy/girl Deepak....An idea of what Deepak is like....He must be some really unhappy person......i promoise you this is what it is like in dealing with Deepak. I bring up an issue where im asking why an article does not have more info, or about editing an article, or about taking something out of an article. And Deepak wont allow me to make edits. So I give Deepak examples and information and trying to back up my edits are legit. And Deepak ignores my logic and doesnt give me alot of logic as to why my info is not valid then So I try to figure out why Deepak is being so strcit. I remind him that i backed up what i said. That i had information that was logical. And why my edits are good. And Deepak calls me a troll and insults me and accuses me of being a nazi lover or somethingSo I answer every insult, every accustation , and every put down that Deepak gives me. And then i remind him of why my edits are valid.And Deepak ignores most of what i write and continues to call me a troll. Or a nazi lover. Or other insults. I then get annoyed and ask Deepak why is he ignoring most of my logic that i write down? Why does he pick and choose what he wants to answer? Why does he not give me logic in return? And Deepak wont reply . I then ask other users about making edits and asking them about my logic and giving them my reasons as to why my edits are valid. And some answer and some agree and some dont. And Deepak all of a sudden starts responding again....with logic? No....with answers? no....with reasoning? no....with information? no....he tells the other users that im a troll and a nazi and pro India then . I then answer all of Deepaks insults. I remind him of why i want edits to be made. I give him my information as to why  my edits are valid then. And Deepak goes back calling me a troll, and a nazi, and a pro India dude. And this kind of stuff goes on and on and on...you get the idea.....he ignores information you give him. He picks and chooses what he wants to answer. And he doesnt even answer the logic you give him sometimes. But he wastes his time in name calling, and insluts, and putting you down then. So then after a while i get annoyed. And i remind him how things got this bad between us. I type and type and type and type just like i am now. And Deepak ignores most of what i typed. Many times i write him these long replies where i answer all his points, where i tell him why its wrong for him to insult me and put me down, and why its wrong for him to ignore the information i have as to why i want to make an edit, or whatever it is im bringing up then.....and no matter how much i write....even if i write these long replies to him then....even if i answer every point he brings up....he usually either ignores most of what i wrote down....or....he picks and chooses what he wants to answer.....or.....he just responds back by calling me a troll, or accusing me of being pro nazi or something, or accusing me of ignoring his points (which is so not true cus i respond to pretty much everything he says then), or accusing me of not understanding what he is telling me, or just accusing me of being pro India then (which I am) or just insulting me, or just name calling me, or just putting me down. So then after a while i get so annoyed cus he's this a guy here then with me now, and so i start to call him names. I call him a dictator. I call him the ruler of wikiepdia. And I tell him how he ignores my points. And then Deepak tells me how i cant call him names, and how i cant throw mud at him, and how im breaking wikipedia rulesSo then I ask him how comes its ok for him to name call me and i cant? How come its ok for him to throw mud at me but I cant then? How come its ok for him to break Wikipedia's rules but I can't then? And Deepak has no logical answer....or....he won't respond to those questions that I ask him then . Or he just ignores what i ask him, and goes back to accusing me of being a troll, or acting like im a pro nazi or something then , or just insult's me in general then......So then I get more annoyed and call him thing's like a dictator, which as you can see here with our history, this is how he acts.....isn't it true?.....he ignores most of my points and picks and chooses what he wants to answer.....sometimes he won't even answer you at all.....and sometime's he just insults you then . So it's logical if get annoyed and call him a dicator right?Wrong....Deepak then holds it against you that your name calling him...and threaten's to block you, or report you, or he just tel	1|0|0|0|0|0

"I'm sorry you are wrong on both counts. Northumbrian is a different dialect to Geordie as you have said. The other dialects from the area are Makem and Pitmatic. Northumbrian being the accent that is common in the larger part of 'Northumberland'. I being from Northumberland myself actually know what I am talking about. If you live in rural Northumberland, bearing in mind that the shire (as Northumberland is a shire county) is mostly rural, you would have a different dialect to someone from Newcastle, Prudhoe, or Gateshead, as the inhabitants of these places generally speak with a Geordie accent. Also no serious linguist would call all these *different* dialects Geordie. I have heard them grouped as Northumbrian dialects but not Geordie dialects. Calling them Northumbrian is correct for two reasons, one being that all these dialects come from the area that is known as Northumbria (That is Northumberland, Durham, Newcastle...etc..).On the other point you are mistake. England (though not the whole UK) can be (rightly) called a Germanic nation. It is true blood is not the deciding factor as you say (though it is connected in some ways), however traditions, language, laws and history are! England was of course founded by...you guessed it Germanic tribes (whether they are the predominant DNA is besides the point. These tribes were the Angles, Saxons, Jutes and Frisians. You can't deny this as before the English kingdoms, England did not exist. Our language is obviously Germanic (though it has borrowed from other languages over the centuries, it is still West Germanic). Most of our common traditions, such as Yule (Yule itself is a Germanic Word, derived from the Norse Jul) are Germanic, the eating of a Christmas Ham, Mistletoe, Christmas trees, Yule Logs...etc…are all Germanic. Many of our laws come direct from Anglo-Saxon and Danish laws, though I agree many were modified by the Normans, who though descended from Norwegians are not culturally Germanic.As for self-identity, I would say that the English identify themselves with Germanic culture, albeit in a subliminal way, for example the fact that they use Anglo-Saxon to describe themselves is an indication of this. They are identifying with tribes that were Danish and Northern German and thus Germanic so on that score yes the English are a Germanic people.And as you bring up DNA casually, then firstly I will point out that it isn't proven either way whether the Anglo-Saxon DNA is more prominent or whether the British (used in this sense as pre-Anglo-Saxon) is. Different surveys have different results, and none have actually been accepted by all experts. And for the most part many of the newer surveys still show that in the North East of England the Germanic percentage is higher than the British (thus the predominant DNA is Germanic), the main problem is that it cannot be determined whether it is Anglo-Saxon or Danish ""Viking"" blood, but this does not make any difference to whether the blood is Germanic. I don't care whether the Modern English have British or Anglo-Saxon blood as I am partly Norse-Gaelic and partly 'English'...thus being a mix. I just do think that the Anglo-Saxon blood is prominent as do many experts, in North Eastern England.Either way Germanic Blood or British Blood...the English are ethnically Germanic.Note: I am not going to lie and say I am not proud of Germanic Culture as it is obvious (especially by my username), but I do consider myself British as the UK isn't about one ethnicity or culture but about the union of many and I am proud of that also. And by the way there is a good case for Northumbria being one of the more Germanic parts, due in a large part to it's folklore especially it's creatures, that include Dvergar (Which they are actually called...they are Dwarves) and Álfar or more correctly Ælfe (as they are in Old English), who are known by the common English word Elf, but are the older and if I may say more correct type.

History 396 outline for Grey OwlCareer:1. Trapper (sub heading under career)His earlier mindset surrounding trapping will be discussed in greater depth, as not much is discussed with regards to how he viewed trapping before his switch to conservationism.His work with the Ojibwa Indians / Guppy Family will be explored as they were critical in his development as a trapper that understood the fragility of the animal ecosystem (Smith, 41)The time of his life spent working and living at the Temagami Inn as a chore-boy will be mentioned as this was one of the events in which  Archie first became an observer of the Objibwa way of life. (Smith, 40)His love interest, Angele will also be discussed as she also introduced Archie to influential figures within the Objibwa community, providing Archie with plenty of sketches for his infamous notebooks.

From the section on his life as a trapper, we will discuss the impact of Anahareo on his switch from trapper to Conservationist.  The transformation of his own personal views of conservationism will be explored through his writings in Pilgrims of the wild.His initial desires to write will also be explored, this section then ending with the completion of his first book “The Men of the Last Frontier” which can be seen as one of the starting points of his public conservation career.Braz, Albert. “St. Archie of the Wild.

Conservation Work with Parks Board Canada (sub heading under Career)Source matter in this subheading will discuss Grey Owl’s beginning with Parks Board Canada through meeting James Harkin, covering material surrounding the films he made with their support, and his placement as caretaker of park animals at Riding Mountain National Park in Manitoba.  His relationship with W. J. Oliver regarding his being commissioned by Parks Board Canada to make films of Grey Owl will also be explored.  We will also delve further into his later life as a conservationist and his role in Prince Albert National park.Lanken, Dane. “The Vision of Grey Owl.” Canadian Geographic 119 (1999): 74-80.Smith, Donald B. From the Land of Shadows: the Making of Grey Owl. Saskatoon: Western Prairie Books, 1990.[edit]Conservationist Views (new heading)His outlook on conservationism will be explored, using both Tina Loo’s “States of Nature” Conserving Canada’s Wildlife in the Twentieth Century, and Donald Smith’s “From the Land of Shadows,” and Grey Owl’s “Pilgrims of the Wild” as sources which deal with his mindset of conservationism in detail.Loo, Tina.

Its 100% right and certain that the benefits have been proposed, and self evident from any reference that have proposed them.  There also does not exist any reliable refutation of any of the list of proposed benefits.  The standard for inclusion as proposed benefits is (or should be) that they are debatable.  There is no evidence that they are implausible, and the points are clearly argued.  It is the most critical section of the entire article after all, and has been up on the page for about 1 year, for the scrutiny of the entire community.  Its likely that any feeling you may have that the information is wrong is misguided, and if you expressed those feelings, you'd have an opportunity to learn from the community why those feelings may be in a weaker debating position than some of the proposed benefits.	0|0|0|0|0|0

" Hu12 administrator apparent libel and abuse Report to a Chair:Hello, this is a request to review an apparently libelous and abusive comment made about a living person at the talk page for Mount Hood, done by administrator Hu12.  Toward the bottom at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Mount_Hood#Climbing_Records  The issue stems from, as you'll see in the article's history section, my interest in adding a simple climbing record listing for Dan Howitt, with the press article references.Hu12's post:After going through the ""google results"" (a disturbing education of sorts), there appears to be a long line of aliases for Dan Howitt, posting over various websites and forums promoting himself and besmirching the characters of fellow climbers and related. Appears this is an attempt to use wikipedia to import offsite conflicts and further an adjenda. It has been removed. I'd suggest that Dan Howitt  read the following, Wikipedia:Wikipedia is in the real world and Law Of Unintended ConsequencesHu12My reply:Please remove Hu12's Libel and Vandalism above and please report this user's abuse to Wikipedia administration. Also, Hu12 of the ""google results"" you searched most are in support of Dan Howitt, with tons of his official summit photos on Rainier, Adams, Hood, Shasta, and listings of his timing officials. You strangely give weight to the abusive chat-site gossip and unsupported libel, and your own post above is of that nature. Chat-sites with this sort of conduct are sad. I'm reporting your libel and abuse to the wiki administration.Saffron1x (talk) Note Hu12 cites a link above as support for his allegations of Dan Howitt.  In reading the chat-site thread, and note it's a mere chat-site and has a lot of personal attacks, gossip, unfounded content, libel, etc, you will, nevertheless, find considerable support for Howitt including climbing record photos, timing officials names, etc.  Hu12 emphasizes the allegations about the use of aliases, and this is gossip and unsupported."	0|0|0|0|0|0

, 12 April 2011 (UTC)You are only now presenting sources for some of the information which you have inserted. In your last revision of the article, you did not cite the sentence about fundamentalism. Once again, the statement about public schools and ID materials was unsourced when you first added it, which is why I removed it. Upon further examination, I removed the statement again because the article never explictly stated that the Centre for Intelligent Design was responsible for the distribution of these intelligent design materials to public schools. It is actually very unlikely that this Centre for Intelligent design did so, in light of the fact that the government proclamation was issued in 2006, and this organization arose in 2010. Finally, believing in the historicity of Adam and Eve does not make one a fundamentalist. Many Christians reconcile the Genesis creation narrative with science (see the BioLogos Foundation for example, which advocates evolutionary creation). The entire Roman Catholic Church (1 billion people) teaches the historicity of Adam and Eve and that does not make them Young Earth Creationists or fundamentalists. I have filed a case on this dispute here and encourage your participation in it. I hope this helps. Thanks, Talk 08:23	0|0|0|0|0|0

Where JoshuaZ the vandal and liar? Show us. So you think saying, ""Now"" is scientific evidence that you are a wise and intelligent teller of the truth or that you know what a reliable and verifiable source is?JoshuaZ, where does Wikipedia's policy say that the Jacob Sheep Association = a reliable and verifiable source that Jacob Sheep are biologically primitive you hypocrite? Explain that hypocrite who personally attacked Starfire777 using lies.Show your references JoshuaZ. Saying, ""Now"" is not a reference that your accusations are true are they? Why can't you make sense Joshua?Again, where did those verses prophecy anything? Do these look like prophecies JoshuaZ?:Joshua also said:""In this case, they did have sources, so you have even less of an argument.""Wrong JoshuaZ. Simply citing sources as you yourself said does not make the source valid. It must be substantiated and verifiable. Why do you conveniently forget that you smug babbling hypocrite?Your later comments don't merit much of a response, but I wThen he said:""ill simply note that accusing people of bigotry, bias, hypocrisy, irrationality and trolling makes my earlier comment about not using ""Darwinist"" as a slur somewhat irrelevant;""Because you said so JoshuaZ, and whatever you said is true is true because you said so.

See how you go round and round in circles using circular reasoning?""if your earlier comment toed the line, the one above crosses it.""Because you said so JoshuaZ, and whatever you say is true because you said so. Science!""I suggest you calm down""I suggest you not use sarcastic insults like that, ok hypocrite? You're implying that the Starfire777 is ill-tempered merely because he points out that you are hypocrite and uses logic to do so (as well as verifiable references on Answersingenesis.com which you lied about not being reliable and being against Wikipedia's rules to cite), ok liar?I suggest you also not command a Christian to follow your moral standards over Christ's, over God's. He is a Christian don't ya know? Are you now God to tell him how to feel and think? I suggest you read this verse and take it to heart which millions of Christians know very well so that you learn how not to offend them again:""Be angry and do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger, and give no opportunity to the devil."" - Ephesians 4:26-27Last time I checked JoshuaZ, neither your nor Wikipedia's rules superceded God's. ""and read the relevant Wikipedia policies and guidelines while you wait for your block to expire.""Oh the old ""you need to read it but I don't"" and ""you sit and think while your grounded young man"" insults. What an arrogant, childish hypocrite you are.I suggest that you stop pretending that whatever you say is true merely because you said it, and again, learn what Starfire777 properly told you to learn.I'll enhance the list for you:Reference, evidence, truth, reality, lie, bigot, hypocrite, fallacy, circular reasoning, troll, stalking, harassment, insults, hatred, and love.And Joshua also said:""This is in addition to issues of original research in regard to Biblical prophecies and other issues on the Charles Darwin page.""Wow you sure like to weasel-word: ""other issues""? What are you references for this vague ""other issues"" JoshuaZ the Policy Master of Wikpedia?And Joshua, who said anything about prophecies? Where did Starfire777 say anothing about prophecies?

" Ward Churchill Admits that He is a Lying SOB Dear , Ward Churchill admitted in front of dozens of reporters and in front of TV cameras, last night, February 22, 2005, that he is NOT in fact an Indian.  He has been lying about his heritage for many, many years and people like me, who live and work in Indian Country everyday, have known for years that he was out and out lying about his heritage.  I repeat:  Ward Churchill during his speech at the University of Hawaii admitted that he is NOT an Indian.  The comment, word for word, was published in the Honolulu Star-Bulletin, Vol. 10, Issue 54Wednesday, February 23, 2005 Churchill attacks essay’s critics by Craig Gima.  I'm going to attempt to be gracious but I have to say that you and  missed the boat on this one.  I'm not going to do it tonight because I do need sleep, but there is going to be huge re-write of the article tomorrow because the article is just flat out wrong now.  These ""allegations"" of ""fabrications"" have been provable facts of fabrications.  It calls into questions so many other things about the guy.  What other things is he out and out lying about???  But more importantly the way that the section on his fake Indian heritage needs to be completely re-written.  Considering the arrogant and sanctimous way that he has treated people like me in Indian Country who dared to question his Indian heritage claims over the years, I think that Indian heritage section needs to play a more centralized role in the article and tomorrow that role is coming.  So many peoplewho do NOT even live in Indian Country, who do NOT work in Indian Countrymade the claim that to dare question the great Ward Churchill's fake Indian heritage was a ""cheap shot.""  We have been hearing that from non-Indians for many, many years and now Churchill has admitted that he lied about it for over 20 years.  He claims that it merely a misunderstanding created by some sloppy reporters.  That is a damn lie too.  He has been claiming Indian heritage for over 20 years.  It is written on either the front cover or back cover of his numerous books.  He refers to the fake Indian scam in newspaper article after newspaper article.  He committed fraud when he applied to the University of Colorado.  The Denver Post has published his employment application and on that application he claimed that he is Indian for affirmation action purposes.  That is a damned lie.  There is going to be re-write and Jodi Rave's comments are going back in and all the rest.  Your attempts to stifle the topic has ended by Churchill himself.- 04:12, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)"	0|0|0|0|0|0

"Hadn't seen that. A lot of material to cover. I am getting an education. )  But I'll be be plain. There has has been a lot of ""quotation mining"" on this page from various POVs. It is what directed me to start reading TALK in the first place and to decide to start editing myself. Good wiki pages demonstrate a synthesis of sources. It is easy to spot when that is not happening, particularly if you have ever been involved in collaborative writing before. A few quick reference checks on the stinkiest stuff - such as Grover Whitehurst appearing to skewer David Elkind - proves that it is happening. All subject matter aside, I detest this. If someone takes the time to write an academic article, or produce a journalistic piece, or enter into a public point/counterpoint debate, others who want to reproduce their thoughts have a moral obligation to summarize the original source authentically. Criticism of it is obviously fine, but only after the original piece has been accurately summarized. IMHO.   "	0|0|0|0|0|0

Thanks for the reply, but i made the suggestion to the editor of the board but he would not listen or even discuss the issue, i have stated that the editor has maintained his own personal views into the article. The editor stated i should go and seek this dispute resolution, because as far as he is concerned he doesnt want anything that he doesnt agree with on articles linked to sikhism, which i deem very one sided and a bit intolerant. Thanks, i would like this issue sorted, i have offered to create an orthodox and unorthodox section on diet in sikhism, i have presented the same scholars that where in the original article, that the editor cited himself, yet when i cited the same scholars to show that they themselves agree that their are passages against meat and many sects against it, the current editor of diet in sikhism again took it off. How can a person cite a scholar and then reject my use of the same scholar when it doesnt fit in with his own POV, which he stated as only being orthodox. I know wiki also has information on Shia unorthodox sect of islam, does that mean we only adhere to one persons view on sikhism, when that person has cited sholars that openly admit that their are passages against meat, if that is the case then why cant relevant verses be shown?

Of course, if you have concerns about my presentation skills, I would be gladly accept your criticism if you leave that comment at my talk page. I think your above personalized comment is not very helpful for the discussion. As for your assertion of [WP:OTHERSTUFFEXISTS]], the method is already used by Tenmei with the three non-English Wikipedias. I'm bit worried that you don't see that. Everyone can challenge the trustworthiness of Wikipedia projects and as stated, Wikipedia is not a reference. How can you prove that the argument that the title used in the three Wikipedias are more neutral and usage of WP:ENGLISH based on what? We don't know where each title at each Wikipedia follows Wikipedia naming convention rules correctly. I think the mention of Oei Invasion is a good comparison for Tenemi to see how he treats similar subjects differently.

"Perhaps I seem to be repeating myself as you are repeatedly ignoring what I'm writing. The tables are unclear as the order of the product is unclear from them. E.g. the top-right corner of the first table is e6. But does that mean e1 × e7 = e6 or e7 × e1 = e6 ? It would not matter if the product is commutative but as it's not the tables are ambiguous. That is why tables are a very poor way to show the product, and probably why none of the sources use them.And again please read MOS:LEAD in paticular the section on providing an accessible overview. Or look at the articles already mentioned, Special relativity and Cross product. Or one you are familiar with, Pythagorean theorem. Or a similarly advanced article to this one (and a featured article), Laplace–Runge–Lenz vector.

" Is this map accurate? =I see some problems with this map:1- It seems to me that this map only shows the very first homo-sapiens immigrations, not the further ones... 1a- For example, regarding New Zealand, this map shows the islands being occupied by melanesian peoples that I suppose to be the morioris, while we know the maoris (the ones who come after the morioris and decimated them) were actually Polinesian... 1b- Europe is shown being occupied by settlers from Anatolia, those were the certainly the Paleo-Europeans... This map does not show the further occupation of Europe by the Indo-Europeans who originated in the Caspian Basin, migrated to Europe and pushed the Paleoeuropeans westards and southwards.1c- The Brazilian Amerindians are not of Colombian ancestry, they are either of Caribbean origin (the Caribs and Arawaks) or of Paraguayan-Northern-Argentine origin (the Tupi-Guaranis).  The bulk of the Amerindians who were in Brazil about the time of the arrival of the Portuguese were these Tupi-Guaranis.  They came from Paraguay and spread all over the Brazilian coast till the valley of the Amazon River.  When you show a map where Brazilian Amerindians are all coming from Colombia, you are showing a totally contradictory information. 1d- The Dravidians reached India from Ethiopia to Yemen, from Yemen to Oman, from Oman to Southeast Iran, from Southeast Iran to the Valley of Indus.  What is shown on that map is that the route of the occupation of India by the Indo-Europeans (from Iran through Bactria).1e- The hipothesis of ancient waves of Paleoeuroepan settling in the eastern coast of North America is ignored, while some geneticists have found evidences of that due to the existance of the Mithocondrial gene ""X"" (""Xenia"") among North-American Native Americans.1f- This map also seems to ignore the Australoid migrations to South America, some people claim that the Australoids have reached South America before the Mongoloids due to some archeological findings in Brazil.Anyways, I believe it should be explained that the migrations of the homo-sapiens show on that map are only the first, the early migrations, and the route of their early settling in India should be corrected.  Also, I would suggest a second map, showing further homo-sapiens migrations (now including the Maori migration from Polinesia, the correct migrations in South America and the settling of the Indo-Europeans in Europe.189.25.2.194  R.

"I must quote what Dominus wrote some time ago on my talk page when I translate I use ""Province of Lower Silesia"" etc. However, here on Wikipedia, I have to go with decisions made long ago. The problem is that Wikipedia is increasingly used for reference by people who are not translators. They should be aware that in ""real life"" the use of ""voivodeship"" results in confusion, as foreigners usually have no idea what this word means. Some Polish people may not care about it because Polish is a reader-responsible language, so Polish authors do not need to write understandably because readers are responsible for understanding. By contrast, English is a writer-responsible language, i.e. writers in English are responsible for making their texts understandable. (I wrote about the classification and some other problems related to translation in my article, pages 101-104). Importantly, this is reflected in the Wikipedia Manual of Style, as one of the five general principles of Wikipedia is Clarity: Writing should be clear and concise. Plain English works best: avoid jargon, and vague or unnecessarily complex wording. ""Voivodeship"" is jargon, understandable nearly exclusively to Polish people.I started a similar discussion in Wikipedia many years ago but I was quickly defeated by people saying that a consensus has been reached and now it's too late. I wish I was more experienced then and knew that ""voivodeship"" is against the principles of Wikipedia.   "	0|0|0|0|0|0

"::Parminder Nagra is a current cast member and plays Dr Neela Rasgotra, so claiming ""one and only Asian female doctor"" is quite untrue (though the comment wasn't signed so I don't know if it was written before or after her debut). But to be honest I fail to see how this is relevant considering this talk page is about the article of a fictional hospital drama.   oh, really, wow, I am impressed, you can give us two Asian female doctors that have appeared on this show, that is impressive, can you tell us how many white female doctors have ever appeared on this show, can you count them with your ten fingers?!

I agree with the above post. The explosion at the end of the film was absolutely not a nuclear explosion.

Festivals Croatia holds an annual Hiccus and Sugar Beet festival every year. It is said to be one of the most underrated festivals in the world. It was created by the beloved princess, Tea Bergauhauer VI. It takes place on the eve of every blue moon and over 13 people participate. Every year the festival is rated number one in hiccus and sugar beet magazine. The prizes consist of prostituted lambs, shower coins, and a luxury mud hut. Celebrities like Babriel Grouse and Nonnor Corthend have visited the festival several times to show the love and appreciation Croatia brings to the table. Police aren't allowed in the event due to citizens putting them on citizens arrest.	0|0|0|0|0|0

" Caspian blue ... Korean-Japanese conflict ... usual MO. Thanks, I noticed your note regarding Caspan blue's removal of my message. Their MO really has to be discussed.I set up the account  purely to document the the abuse of the Wiki system by Caspian blue in support of their ongoing Japanese-Korean conflict at articles such as Yonsei/Severance Hospital or Comfort women, see here . See note of typical edit war, here; .Caspian themselves are investing an inordinate amount of time exaggerating this whole situation.The funny thing is, before I started this project, I had no prejudices against Koreans whatsoever and tend to take each person as they come. My issue was solely with the manner and methods ""Caspian blue"" were employing to take control over topics and waste others time and energy, having experienced similar on other subject matters. I do not think that hysteria and racial prejudices have any place in an encyclopedia.

" This is a relatively new website, but pardon if I'm mistaking; Randi Harper is the CEO of OAPI (correct?) This same Randi Harper has been accused of abuse, bullying & harassment by another Online Abuse Prevention Website STGRB - Stop The GR Bullies: Harper organized a revolt to write ""bad reviews"" of Amazon books by authors Harper didn't like - She contacted Amazon directly through her OAPI website to get several books (from authors she didn't like) pulled from Amazon. It was first made public by Anne Rice; 'Interview With The Vampire' author & supporter of STGRB through her Facebook Account and continued updates through her Twitter Account. Harper rallied her Twitter followers to publicly attack Rice and write articles in gossip websites bluntly lying that Anne Rice is the harasser. I think it would be best to remove the WIKI Online 'Abuse Prevention Initiative' entry (at least) until OAPI actually establishes itself, because (1) this could be construed as advertisement, (2) we're promoting Harper's repeated hostilities, and (3) we're certain to see rampant vandalism in response to this WIKI.

" Why will Gwen Gale not read the sources? On 01:27, 5 August 2010 I posted a section on ""Talk: Death of Adolf Hitler"" titled “Random Questions” which started “I am not a scholar, I read Wiki but would not think of editing it. But I was disappointed in this article, and many points in the discussion, so I am asking some questions. Perhaps someone else will read and address them.” The section went on with several rethoritical questions, and ended with “As to sources, the last books I have read are The Murder of Adolph Hitler by Hugh Thomas (sort of shaky) and The Last Days of Hitler by Anton Joachimsthaler (English translation, I buy much of this).”Gwen Gale was apparently assigned me as an administrator, because at  she replied with: ”As the article lead says,...This said, this talk page isn't a forum for talking about personal views or questions on a topic, it's meant for talking about sources and how to echo them in the text. I say this because the article seems to already cover, with thorough citations, most if not all of what you've brought up...dodgy. Gwen Gale (talk)”By this reply it appears that Gwen Gale is NOT FAMILIAR with the work of Joachimsthaler, who I have just referenced, and thinks that I am asking a personal question, not a rhetorical one. At that time I apologized, tried to explain myself, and restate my questions.At  I posted” If I had read Kershaw's Nemesis Chapter 17 note 156 and Epilogue note 1 I wouldn't have wasted your time. You can't get much clearer than that. Should be required reading. Perhaps someone else should read them, and possibly edit the article. Thank you for your time.99.41.251.5 (talk)”At  I posted “I would like to direct people to the work of Ian Kershaw Hitler, 1939-1945: Nemesis ISBN 0393322521. Chapter 17 and the epilogue relate to this article. Please pay attention to his notes and sources. Be warned, his book Hitler: a Biography is a kind of digest which does not include these resources....The source Joachimsthaler is basically an English translation of a German's analysis of 1950's post-Soviet interviews of bunker survivors. The original transcripts must be available somewhere. There are many other bunker interviews, some with questionable intent, and not all agree. Wm5200 (talk)“Since those posts I have posted a huge amount on the talk page, virtually all of which Gwen Gale has disputed. Much of the material I have posted I have later deleted, often because I felt that the endless conflict between Gwen Gale and myself is counterproductive to the article. Anyone who is Wiki can probably bring back any of those posts. Was I sometimes rude and argumentative? Absolutely. Was I making legitimate points which related to the article? I thought so. Did I receive effective support and encouragement by my administrator? I think not, but you judge.My main point was that Joachimsthaler had reviewed the information, and had made a solid case for positions which Kershaw backed. I repeatedly begged anyone, especially Gwen Gale, to read Joachimsthaler and Kershaw, specifically, two footnotes, I even told the pages of the footnotes. Gwen Gale clearly had not read either source. I posted, under the heading “Question for Gwen Gale” , the following: ”I lost you, but I’m confused myself. It appears as though the person with the least information available is most influential on the article.My very low budget suburb is in a system which serves 225,000 people with 4 MILLION titles (numbers approximate, thanks Carol). Kershaw, Joachimsthaler, Thomas, Trevor-Roper, Beevor, Shirer, Ryan, Toland, Eberle/Uhl, Lehmann/Carroll, O’Donnell, Victor, Petrova/Watson. (Vinogradov hit a snag, reordered). These are books which I have had in my possession and read parts of since Aug 2010. I can understand if others do not have access to the same resources, but I think that should be addressed. If someone does not have access to two footnotes which are critical in a discussion, that also should be addressed...I know that this is P.O.V., and that I am personally involved. But I can not help but believe that this article has problems with it’s process.Wm5200 (talk)'""On  Gwen Gale posted “For starters, the Russian autopsy bore overwhelming evidence he not only shot himself, but bit down on a cyanide capsule. Gwen Gale (talk)”. By this post it is clear to anyone familiar with either Joachimsthaler or Kershaw that Gwen Gale is still not familiar with either work'''.

" External links on ballet Hello! External links are often taken as a ""For further reading"" section, and as such, should complement the article, adding information we could not. As for ballet terminology, Wikipedia has a Glossary of ballet, and as we are working to create free content, it is more beneficial for us to create a better repository of terms and their meanings than to link to a copyrighted collection. Similarly, we shouldn't be linking to content which we should have, or which is only marginally related (physics of all dance is only marginally related to ballet). However, if you meant to reference a section, there's a different method of going about this documented at Wikipedia:Citing sources. The links used would be contained in a ==References== section, and it'd especially help if you could indicate which facts were verified and which weren't. The Ballet article is currently undergoing a rewrite, and any help you could offer would be appreciated (see the talk page and WikiProject Ballet's article improvement page for more information on what needs doing).

"== Cohanim J2 - Eleazar - Phinchas - Zadok == Agree. Dr. Karl Skorecki have the final word about Cohanim genetic signatures. He, more than anyone else, is the most credible person that can publish articles and true informations about Cohanim genetic signatures, not Jheald. He was the one who discovered the CMH in 1997. After 10 years, he came out to announce in 2007, that ""he and his research team have discovered not one but two Cohen Modal Haplotypes, which he called J1 and J2"". Katz, Kaplan, Rappaport, Shapiro, Kovacs,Konh, are all J2. Those surnames and families are the most prestigious Cohanim families today. They are all Cohanim J2. J2 Cohanim is much more common than J1 Cohanim. ""Skorecki reported that Pinchas the zealot mentioned in the Bible may be the origin of J2"" This is a very important information that confirms matematical, historic, and genealogy facts. Phinchas was the son of Eleazar. Itamar was his brother. Out of the 24 Cohanim houses, 16 did belong to Eleazar-Pinchas, while only 8 came out from Itamar seed. Eleazar-Pinchas (J2) had a much larger population than Itamar. All Cohanim genealogy were divided into those two houses, until the destruction of the second temple. So, if Phinchas is the origin of all Cohanim J2, than it makes sense, since his Cohanim seed produced much more descendants than his brother Itamar. So, it is very normal and logical to understand why genetic cohanim signatures presents two CMHs wich is the caracteristics of the two houses of Cohanim. All genealogic tree for Cohanim since Aaron until today are still divided into these two houses: Eleazar-Pinchas and Itamar. During the 1270 years of the cohanim services (Mishkan and Mikdash) the Cohanim jews were always selected by the 24 houses. 18 from Pinchas, and only 8 from Itamar. That´s why J2 Cohanim is almost twice as common than J1 Cohanim"" —Preceding unsigned comment added by 189.27.127.148   WHAAAAT{During the 1270 years of the cohanim services (Mishkan and Mikdash) the Cohanim jews were always selected by the 24 houses. 18 from Pinchas, and only 8 from Itamar.

Dr. Karl Skorecki of the Ramban/Technion Medical Center in Haifa, who is renowned for his discovery in 1997 of the Kohen genetic signature, reported in 2007 that he and his research team have discovered not one but two Cohen Modal Haplotypes, which he called J1 and J2. ""Pinchas, the zealot mentioned in the Bible, may be the origin of J2"" he suggested. The extended CMH-12 is established for J1 Cohanim only. If somebody in J1 also has CMH-12, then he is likely to have Cohen ancestry. J1 Cohanim form a tight network around CMH-12. But this is not the case for J2. The CMH-12 does not apply to J2. If a J2 is in CMH-12, it tells us nothing about one being a Cohen. In J2, the CMH-12 has no special status. The J1 lineage of Cohanim in CMH-12 could be much more recent.  Jewish Cohanim in J2 form a much larger network around CMH-6  than Jewish Cohanim in J1 do. Cohanim Jews belong mainly to haplogroup J2 because Cohanim as a group (J1,J2) have a high frequency of J2. The J2 Cohanim have much more ancient common ancestor, according to the *observed* mutation rate (which is three times faster than the standard, ""effective"" rate). J2 Cohanim serves as the deep background of the priestly Jewish caste (J1,J2). “The finding of J2 among contemporary Cohanim can lend credence that today’s Cohanim (J1,J2) may be descendents of two different founding dynasties – including coalescence to Phinchas as the founder of J2 Cohanim” concluded Dr. Karl Skorecki.Why the confirmation that Phinchas may be the orign of J2 Cohanim is so important?“Pinchas, son of Elazar, son of Aharon the Kohen turned back My anger from upon the Children of Yisrael, so I did not destroy the Children of Yisrael. Therefore say - behold, I give to him My covenant of peace” (Numbers 25:10 - 30:1). “God gave to Pinchas a new permanent priesthood, for him and his descendants for all generations.” (Zohar HaKadosh 3:124a). God indicated that Phinchas had acted justly by rewarding him with the most counter-intuitive form of blessing - an all-new form of priesthood. He is given the Divine Covenant of Peace and the gift of eternal priesthood. Zadok, a des	0|0|0|0|0|0

I have been trying to seek consensus for including the Israeli claim that Hamas started firing rockets circa June 30 at DRN. However, it may also be worth noting that Israel maintains the Hamas members killed in Khan Yunis accidentally blew themselves up in one of their tunnels: ""Hamas has vowed revenge for what it saw as Israel's deadliest attacks in which six Palestinian militants died, though Israel denied any involvement...The Israeli military said its aircraft had targeted ""terror sites and concealed rocket launchers"" in the enclave, but had not hit the southern Gaza area of Rafah, on the Egyptian border, where the Hamas gunmen died. Military spokesman Lerner said the militants had died when explosives went off in a tunnel that Israel had bombed several days ago, fearing gunmen planned to use it to try and penetrate into Israel."" It turns out the same account was given by The New York Times: ""When Hamas militants entered the damaged tunnel a day or so later, they apparently set off explosives there...Hamas blamed Israel, escalating the hostilities that grew into the current confrontation."" Hamas' claim that seven of its members were killed by an Israeli airstrike is not an assertion Wikipedia should parrot uncritically.  "	0|0|0|0|0|0

Anyone not self repressed enough to understand simple religious psychology can already see this in you.Deep down inside you know this is true, but your subliminal self hatred keeps you in denial of such facts. And, as such we are going to ask that you... ""Please discontinue removing the Urantia Readers-Intl group and replacing it with the Fellowship link"". See how that works in contrast? So you want to play sound games, or do you want to fight fire with fire.... jerks. As such let us repeat the same again...  if you delete us, we delete you (Fellowship); if you put the Urantia Book Fellowship link back in, and keep ours in, the we keep yours in; if you place the Urantia Book Fellowship link above us, we will place our link above you... you want a war, you got it.

I posted on the talk page in order to achieve consenus. Pink didnt reply and kept reverting. I again posted a second section on the talk page,and pink did reply but still kept reverting. So if neither of us should have been reverting, please tell this to pink and his/her meatpuppet wild. Pink/wild then had the page locked, of course to their version. Consensus still has not been reached. The source (AOL Black Voices) was deemed fine as it is a AOL entertainment site on African-American celebrities. It is backed by AOL Time Warner so the articles posted their aren't rumours, they are credible, as AOLTW could be sued for libel. 70.108.59.145	0|0|0|0|0|0

"Regrettably, I have to agree about the Gameplay section. It comes off more like an academic discourse on the incorporation of multiple characters and changes from previous franchise entries in video games, using Mother 3 as an example, than a proper encyclopedic entry. I won't quickfail just for this, but I do want it fixed before I'll pass. I'd prefer the section to be rewritten entirely, but some glaring points follow:""Mother 3 is presented in eight chapters with rotating player-characters including the protagonist's ""cowboy father"", the ""family dog"", an ""inept thief"", and ""abused monkey"""" - So is the protagonist not playable? How large is the party? Why are these descriptions in quotes? - it suggests equivocation in your understanding of the characters. Actually, why isn't the protagonist named in this section? Again, I completely understand the desire to approach this from an out-of-universe perspective, but only to the point where the prose doesn't trip over its own detachment.""Mother 3 begins with naming the members of the player-character's family along with questions of the player's favorite food and ""thing"",[3] and opens to a ""pastoral forest village"" soon interrupted by a forest fire and the Pig Mask Army, who impose police state-like conditions on the village.[2] With the fire's outbreak, the father ventures out to protect his family (twin sons Lucas and Claus and wife Hinawa), but the rest of the world is eventually implicated in the plot.[1] They set out to take down the Pig Mask Army.[4] Lucas, the game's hero, does not become prominent until the fourth chapter. The game features a lighthearted plot, with enemies like ""partying ghosts"" and ""talking rope snakes"".[5] Porky, a character from EarthBound, appears as the leader of the Pig Mask Army and is the game's main antagonist. In addition, other EarthBound characters, such as Dr. Andonuts and Mr. Saturn, also appear."" - Why isn't this stuff in Plot? The cast of characters does need to be introduced better, but jamming plot details into Gameplay isn't the way to do that.The second paragraph is better; it's more in line with what I expect from a GA gameplay section. At least, it's good until ""Apart from this rhythm and combo mechanic, the battle system is similar to that of its predecessor."" What's the predecessor's battle system like? Remember, not everyone reading this has played EarthBound.""There is no need to grind for experience and it has no random battles"" - First of all, this should start off with a ""However"" or something of the like as its predecessor does have those things. The information is also lacking, though - why isn't there a need to grind for experience? I think of this as one of the central, love-it-or-hate-it JRPG mechanics, and I'm curious as to how the genre might work without it. Imagine reading a Pokémon game article that simply states that you can change your party as needed (which is unusual for a JRPG) without giving a brief overview of how the PC and Day Care systems work - that's how I feel reading this."" and lets the player see their magic ""PSI power"" abilities"" - Viewing your abilities probably isn't a necessary gameplay detail, but why isn't there anything on the abilities themselves and their use in battle? And do they have uses outside battle, like HMs, Rock Smash, Secret Power, and Softboiled do in Pokémon?""While Mother 3's music is both similar in tone to its predecessors and completely new, it features similar sound effects."" - By ""completely new"" do you mean it isn't recycled wholesale, or that the style is somehow new? Also, this bit probably doesn't belong in Gameplay.If you're up to rewriting this, which I encourage - especially if you're shooting for FA - I'd recommend a structure like the following:Paragraph 1: It's a top-down JRPG, there's an overworld, you explore towns with your team of characters, yada yada yada.Paragraph 2: There are battles, they're not random (with an explanation of the conditions under which you do encounter battles - is it like in Pokémon Colosseum where you only fight other Trainers, or like in Dragon Ball Z: Buu's Fury where you can see the enemies on the overworld before fighting them?), this is how the battle system works, this is how items work, this is how experience points/leveling work (again, how is this the case without grinding? Or is a different system used entirely?).Paragraph 3: Your team consists of such-and-such a number of characters, they change with different events in the story, characters do/don't return once they leave, here are examples of the characters and how they differ in and out of battle.Stuff like items and saving (can you save anywhere?) - work in wherever you want; I'm not picky.   21:47, 25 September 2014 (UTC	0|0|0|0|0|0

Additionally, users who perform a large number of reversions in content disputes may be blocked for edit warring, even if they do not technically violate the three-revert rule. If you continue, you may be blocked from editing. Please do not repeatedly revert edits, but use the talk page to work towards wording and content that gains a consensus among editors. If necessary, pursue dispute resolution.   Remember that as per WP:CCC no consensus is permanent.  I have proposed a change as per WP:BOLD, and see no protest from any users other than yourself.

No apologies I make no apologies for what I said on the humanities reference desk. At times, I may have gone too far elsewhere in wikipedia but not in this instance. When people say stupid things on the reference desk, I have no qualms about pointing this out and am not likely to change any time in the future, especially when it is unlikely the person who asked the question is being sincere. Note that assume good faith doesn't really apply in the reference desk, else we wouldn't be able to suggest that users are asking homework questions (which we do all the time) or otherwise just wasting our time (which we do as well). I rarely frequent the humanities reference desk, mostly science only, so perhaps you don't get as many cranks at humanities but really I don't care. Stupid questions deserve pointed replies.

"Okay, I disagree with this just as strongly as I disagree with attempts to say he wasn't Jewish.  Firstly, Marx didn't kill anybody, nor did his ideology.  A bunch of people claiming to be inspired by his ideas killed millions of people.  And given that the German people managed to produce some unquestionably German people who unquestionably actually did murder millions of people, I'm not going to weep for the fact that the Germans are also saddled with responsibility for one of the greatest political philosophers of the nineteenth century.  Beyond that, Marx was born and grew up in Germany with a very limited connection to his Jewish ancestry.  His primary language was German, and this is the language in which he wrote most of his works.  Although he spent most of his later life in England, I've never really heard that he didn't always consider himself to be a German - I'd think, in fact, that living in England would have accentuated that.  While I do think that his Jewish background is important, and make it perfectly reasonable to describe him as a Jew, his German background was substantially more important than his Jewish one.  His own works emerged out of post-Hegelian debates within the German philosophical community, and his greatest influence throughout his life (and for several decades afterwards) was in Germany, where Marxists were far more dominant within the socialist community than they were in most other parts of Europe (Britain, France, and Russia, in particular, had their own, non-Marxist, socialist traditions that were not assimilated into Marxism for a long time, if ever).  Marx was German of Jewish descent.  Being an ""internationalist"" is a statement of intentions for the future of the world, not of present day identity.   "	0|0|0|0|0|0

"Hey I tried to leave a message on your discussion page but it was very confusing, it was different than the last guy I talked to. Anyway, if you see this the criteria that fits is that it is on a reputable indie label with reputable artists.  John Jared Bowes (a.k.a maybe me) has been published in reputable magazines.  And both Ultra Sonic Edukators and The Billions have been played on ""any"" national radio station...I put a link to one of the national radio stations that the Ultra Sonic Edukators are currently on rotation on.  There is more stuff that I could dig up...but I feel I have already qualified by the criteria that is given on here.  John Jared Bowes is a very confusing guy, thats why his article is confusing...also if get bored...check out my blog www.ultrasonicedukators.com and click on satellite bowes...its pretty funny."	0|0|0|0|0|0

"I mean really, they are a new editor that appeared to be editing on good faith, adding information that was included in an already used source. Their edit summary didn't show any hostility, so you should not retaliate with any. Odds are, they haven't even looked at their talk page, so your comment won't be read anyways. If the act of reverting dubious additions from new users is stressing you out, maybe this is a problem you should see about solving, instead of acting like it is a personal attack on you. Plus, Antoshi already warned them on their talkpage, and they have not added anything since, showing that maybe they have listened to the advice. Your threat was completely unnecessary. Maybe explaining to them that the information has already been added, but rejected, and why would be a better option. WP:AGF and WP:BITE are very important.

Take your time. If and when you go over the history of Yost again, I will be curious about any mention of scheme, especially if such also mentioned McGugin.  If it gives accounts of either one punting, that too adds a certain color to their story. Given their emphasis on it, one has to get a kick (pun(t) not intended) out of Yost teaching his boys to punt or McGugin booming punts in an all-star game in his 7th year at Vandy. Would you happen to know if Yost ran the same schemes at his various jobs before Michigan? I would assume so and have a few other tenuous reasons to think so.	0|0|0|0|0|0

": I understand quite well the situation in Albanian because it occurs also in my native Romanian and other Balkan languages (e.g. in Romanian ""great man"" is usually omul mare or un om mare, but it also can be marele om). It is related to compound names and nouns, and actually you brought it up when you started lecturing on Albanian ""structures"" in a post-scriptum. All your examples come from modern Albanian, not from Proto-Albanian whatever language it was. I can add some etymologies such as the one Orel provided for thënukël = ""dogberry"", from earlier *thënubël < PAlb. *tsunu-abōla, cf. Lith. šúnobuolas, Dacian kinouboila (= ""dog's apple""). In what you quoted so far, Hamp did not claim anything about Proto-Albanian compound nouns or syntax. Please provide relevant bibliography, otherwise I don't see why should we be dismissive of other scholars' theories. Orel, Georgiev and many others are also linguists.   "	0|0|0|0|0|0

Look, a lenghty exchange of opinions can be a nice thing, but since you two have now discussed the rough equivalent of 3-4 pages, this discussion is obviously stalled. Let me try to sum up what I think about this topic:Please be aware that WP:ATT (like any other WP policy) isn’t written in stone, and SaltyBoatr's extremely literal interpretation of one sentence of this policy is most likely not what it was meant to say.every article published in Foreign Affairs is reviewed by other scientists, which is much more than you could say for any “reliable” newspaper or just about every university publication. That should be enough to make sure WP:ATT isn’t a good reason to ban them.I have to agree with Ultramarine: if you use your interpretation of WP:ATT consequently, there’s only a handful of WP-articles that would survive the necessary mass-deletion of references. (What’s more, I think it would be some pretty bad ones, those that rely entirely on newspaper articles)Finally: There really is no good reason why articles that I could use in every Political Science paper and any scientific article shouldn’t be enough for Wikipedia. -	0|0|0|0|0|0

"Kurdistan?Kurdistan is not a geo-political region. There's a region called Kurdistan in Iraq. There's a region called Kurdistan in Iran. There's no region called Kurdistan in Turkey. That's akin to placing an Algeristan in France, and making an article that treats it like a country. There are some country articles on wiki that list less facts than a supposed region. Kurds are a minority in Turkey, just like the Hispanics in USA or Algerians in France. As ludicrous as it would seem to place a Mexicistan or Algeristan on those countries where those minorities are heavily populated in, it is to list a Kurdistan that includes Turkish territory. As long as we don't declare San Diego Mexicistan, which Mexico actually did own at one point and not just have a ripped-up treaty claiming it, it is equally ridiculous to list Kurdistan in Turkey. In Iraq, a country that was set up by the British merging 3 territories, a region called Kurdistan warrants an article, as the Kurds were just placed together with other ethnicities by a colonizing force. But I call BS on Turkey being listed under Kurdistan, as Turkey does not have a region named Kurdistan, and Kurds are Turkish citizens, not living under a Kurdish ""state"" like in Iraq, whom prints their own passports and such.

"Where do you see Dennis saying ""step it up""?  The only thing close to that is his comment here to 'bump it up', which is clearly referring to DRN, the Wikipedia:Dispute resolution noticeboard which is a step in the overall Wikipedia Dispute Resolution process; and it is very clear that User:BeCritical understands that Dennis is talking about the WP:DR process, because BeCritical actually refers to Arbitration, followed by Dennis mentioning WP:RFC/U and Wikipedia:Arbitration.  ""Stepping it up"" and/or ""bumping it up"" has nothing to do with a suggestion to go to more extreme behavior in an attempt to elicit a sanctionable reaction from you.  Nor do any of the other comments by Dennis even suggest such a thing be done, or has been done.

Perhaps I should have saved myself the trouble, and just stayed in the icy water.Your comments are interesting and may well be correct, however they don't really address the point I was making, regarding the gross, almost embarrassingly obvious, errors in the ""academic geek created/mindless computer driven"" financial models currently used around the world.  The most similar ""theory"" to the one I've pustulated above comes out of  this piece from ""The Prophet"" Robert K. Landis, where he predictes a combined deflationary/stagflationary financial crisis.  Ludwig von Mises obviously had similar ideas, but no one has really done the ""hard"" financial modelling on this Austrian School theory, and tried to collect long-term historical data, tracking changes in debt levels over time and compared this to volatility levels (the frequency and severity of so-called ""black swan events"") in financial markets.  My hypothesis is that with increasing margin lending and debt levels, you will see bifurcating bell curve returns (i.e. extremely high returns or extremely negative returns, with few data points in the range of the long term mean during these periods of heavy net indebtedness).Landis comes close, but still no (Cuban) cigar.  Anyway, his piece is very topical right now, and made for interesting bedtime reading, tucked away here as I am in my tiny little third class cabin, far far away from the ""mad money"" crowd.

Article revised for flow, and minor correctionsI have made a start on editing the article’s minor errors of grammar, syntax and flow. I hope this is acceptable to the other editors who have already done such a good job here. Although I have changed the order of some of the information (trying to lead from the general to the particular), I have not removed any so far as I am aware. I have added some details about the attack on the cornerstone ceremony. I have also revised the numbers of aggressors and victims in this attack, in line with those in the existing cited sources. I’m not sure where the article’s original figure of 4,000 Serbs came from. Have I overlooked a reference?  If so I apologize and ask that it be restored. Anyway this change may well be temporary if someone can find other equally (or more) reliable souce(s).If the established editors here are unhappy with what I've done, please feel free to revert.I think the article could use quite a few more cites.	0|0|0|0|0|0

Removal of Looney Tunes and DC Comics Branding in Late 2010In later 2010, the Looney Tunes and DC Comics branding were removed from the park and replaced with different branding in time for the 2011 season. I wonder why Six Flags would remove characters that they have the rights to use at their theme parks. I mean they use those characters at all the other Six Flags parks so it doesn't make since that the company would remove them. Is it because Great Escape is not a branded Six Flags park and is just owned by the company?75.68.122.13  Jacob Chesley the Alternate Historian	0|0|0|0|0|0

What follows from this? Niles was a DR in 1811; if he avoided party propaganda, so much the clearer his example on usage. The rest of this says that he declined to follow either of the two major branches dividing the party in 1824, and that he finally left Jackson's branch altogether. That he was not a Democrat makes his use of Democratic-Republican more interesting, not less.	0|0|0|0|0|0

The paragraph suggesting that ""Dutch"" used to mean what ""German"" means today is ridiculous.

So yes, it does make sense to emphazise that Pennsylvania Dutch is a misinterpretation and that the immigrants were in fact German.

However in its current form it does not in any way reflect the complexity or interest inherent in the problem. As an example of a recent paper which relates to your question, so may interest you please see [Moving Observers in An Isotropic Universe]. The paper itself can be downloaded [Pdf version]. This paper differs from my own view - but illustrates the inherent and enduring interest of the problem. My major objection to the wikipedia article in its current form is it solves the paradox by mistating it. i.e. by stating a non-paradox in place of the interesting one(s). How can I go about getting the article expanded to reflect the varying points of view? I don't wan't to get involved in a reverting war. Any advice you can give me would be much appreciated	0|0|0|0|0|0
"Created and dominated[Hamilton] created and dominated the Federalist PartyHuh? Nobody ""created"" the Federalist Party; it didn't have a founding convention or a recruitment list; it began as a caucus of officials already serving. It is equally peculiar to find Hamilton's relations to the party described as ""domination"". Usually the party Boss doesn't have to intrigue (largely unsuccessfully) against two of the party's nominations for high office, nor risk his life to secure a third; he picks himself and nobody argues - that's what dominate means.

"I repeat, the text was about a minority school (these schools were the same for every minority) not about the treatment of Germans in the public. Secondly, the ""weak identity"" thing is a nice lie, because then you have to explain why the Slovaks did not have ""weak identity"" in Romania or in Serbia and now there are more of them in those countries than in Hungary, although the opposite was the case after the population exchange (I will answer you: because their schools were shut down in the 1960s). Thirdly, you somehow ""forget"" that whether the minorities (not only Slovak) have a ""weak identity"" or not, the Hungarian government - unlike the governements of all its neighbouring countries - has abolished schools with the respective languages as languages of instruction (you can play with words, but that is a fact), bilingual schools - even if they would work, which they did not - are not enough and above all there was absolutely no reason for such a deterioration other then finishing the Magyarisation (and this aim was successfully achieved). Or are you implying that since the minorities had such ""weak identity"", the government decided to help them by cancelling education in their mother language?? Do you actually read what you write?

" about your comment on Elaragirl's talk page Hello Dev920, I couldn't help but notice your comments on  talk page under the heading ""Esperanza"", so I'm sorry if you feel this was an intrusion of your privacy (or Elaragirl's). I wanted to remind you that there is a spectrum of individual editors who claim affiliation with Esperanza, and some editors, how shall I say this? contribute less towards the mainspace than others.  As for the governance issue, I personally don't understand the current structure and I don't feel as if they exert any influence on me at any rate.I still think that an off-Wikipedia coffee lounge that has an obvious link on Esperanza's page is the best way to satisfy those users who like to spend their time in the lounge, and still address the concerns of those who are opposed to its presence on Wikipedia. What's one more click of the mouse? Just so you know, I had participated a little in the coffee lounge, but I got turned off of it because of the random dog barking and a series of dirty jokes which I felt were sexist, offensive, and not at all belonging on Wikipedia. Because I had participated only to a limited extent, my overall edit count (2971 as of ) wasn't seriously affected when the coffee lounge was deleted.I had proposed a hypothetical merger between Esperanza, the Kindness Campaign, and Concordia, and while I still think that many of their stated goals overlap, I also feel that Esperanza needs to better define itself before even considering such a merger, and feedback must be solicited from members of all three groups. I was unaware that Esperanza had a prior history of attempting mergers in the past. If you feel that my suggestion was naive and arrogant, chalk it up to my own shortsightedness, not to Esperanza as a whole.I know that we may differ in our views of what to do with Esperanza, but at least the MfD and in particular comments by you, Elaragirl, and others, have given the impetus for Esperanza to examine itself. Thank you for that.Since I've typed this much, I might as well invite you to review me at editor review. Thanks again for your participation in all of this.  "	0|0|0|0|0|0

From my standpoint you are the confused. I'm looking at it in the 3rd person. What the alliances were in this ancient time is unclear. Fact is that the Britons were in an anti-Angles coalition and the Angles came with their whole volk to defeat them. If the Britons had contact to the former Roman Empire is unclear but possible. They lived under Roman rule for centuries and were romanized. This defeat was something like de-romanizing to them after 500 years of Roman rule. This can clearly be seen when you read and understand the Roman Britain-Anglo-Saxon battles in Germanic Wars.	0|0|0|0|0|0

Yep, that all makes perfect sense, and the move is uncontroversial with me and the page's creator, with whom I discussed this a bit on the Talk page when I made my initial, ill-fated moves.  Just to clarify what I was after with singular v. plural (so as not to appear a plodding dolt), I meant that if we were to push an article toward being about a genre in which works can be referred to in the singular or plural, the singular seems to be the preferred usage in discussing genre.  A point of general interest: the other, singular pinakes listed in the Suda entry aren't considered parts of the work known as the Pinakes, that being Πίνακες τῶν ἐν πάσῃ παιδείᾳ διαλαμψάντων, καὶ ὧν συνέγραψαν.  I don't know that I believe that interpretation of the testimonia and fragments, but who am I?  Going this route, I'd actually be alright with no mention of the/any Pinakes appearing on the Pinax page: this uncited bit about a map picture is a bit too creative for my taste, considering the other basic meaning and the existence of the πίναξ ἐκκλησιαστικός at Athens.  Thanks for looking at this and I hope that I can get back to that article soonish and will be thinking about the extra-Callimachean angle that need to be pursued—please let me know if any other names come to mind.	0|0|0|0|0|0

P.P.S.  Me yet again.  I forgot to mention, the photo of the two French marine infantrymen must, I think, date from 1884 or 1885 rather than as late as 1888.

He took part in the Bac Ninh campaign (March 1884) and the Lang Son Campaign (February 1885).  I'm pretty sure the picture, which is one of a suite of images he took in Tonkin that have been published on the internet, dates from 1884, and have said so when I used it in my Tonkin Expeditionary Corps article.

"For what it's worth, I suggest you refrain from pushing the ""socks"" remarks around, as it only seems to add fuel to the matter. Given that an SPI has been opened and Checkuser denied due to Stale accounts and behaviour evidence alone, it serves no purpose to accuse him further, just as it serves no purpose for him to accuse you of stalking. No one is going to win that type of argument. Also, I suggest you stop calling cowboy ""Jake"" from now on, as it also implies that he is someone he claims not to be. Clearly he is determined to push his case, and the only way to make it go away is that you ignore him altogether. Socks are a complex issue as they come in different forms. But if you give them enough rope, they'll eventually hang themselves with it. Challenging suspected socks non-stop is sometimes considered uncivil and may seem like a personal attack without confirmation. SPI does not support the claim at present, and baiting cowboy will not look good on your behalf, whatever the outcome. I'm sure, by ""rotating IP"" he probably means proxies.

"==Another specific example====Under Genetic explanations, WRN has written this - To support these claims, they often cite several lines of evidence that they interpret as support for a partly genetic cause of group differences in IQ:   1. Black–White–East Asian differences in IQ, reaction time, and brain size are observed worldwide in a range of cultures and environments. In the United States, significant Black-White IQ differences are observable at every age above 3 years, within every occupation or socioeconomic level tested, in every region of the country, and at every time since the invention of ability tests.[106]   2. Jensen and other have argued that the magnitude of race differences on different IQ subtests correlate with the extent to which those subtests measures g,[107] which also correlates with measures of the subtests heritability.[108] From these and other findings, they argue that race differences have a partly biological basis.[109]   3. The rising heritability of IQ with age (within all races; studies have found on average in the developed world heritability starts at 20% in infants, rises to 40% in middle childhood, and peaks at 80% in adulthood); and studies showing the virtual disappearance (~0.0) by adulthood of shared environmental effects on IQ (for example, family income, education, and home environment), with adopted siblings partaking in the studies no more similar in IQ than with strangers[110] From these studies, they argue that most suggested environmental explanations for IQ difference between groups do not have a strong enough effect on IQ to fully account for group differences.4. Studies of US comparisons of both parents to children and siblings to each other finding regression to differing means for different races (85 for Blacks and 100 for Whites) across the entire range of IQs,[111] despite the fact that siblings are matched for shared environment and genetic heritage, with regression unaffected by family socioeconomic status and generation examined[112]This seems to be excessive detail.  WRN has essentially recreated Rushton/Jensen arguments, and placed citations in his citation.  This essentially allows WRN to write an entire section, as if it were incontrovertible based on various references, without any possible response.  The NPOV fact that should be reported is that Rushton and Jensen make some assertions, not that they make some assertions, and here is the factual evidence they use to back it up.  If anything, every one of their ""lines of evidence"" should be attributed directly to Rushton and Jensen, as much of that same evidence may be interpreted as undermining the ""genetic hypothesis"", depending on the viewer.  It seems very weaselly, in any case. Can we agree these four points should be removed from the article?  Comments?  =="	0|0|0|0|0|0

It is also against the Hippocratic Oath; which states: ""Do no harm."" Circumcision is harmful to infants and the men that they will become. A circumcision itself takes 1/3 to 1/2 of the male shaft skin on the penis. It also takes over 2000 fine touch nerve sensors, the gentle gliding mechanism that is offered by the foreskin, and the protection of the foreskin itself. It causes unnecessary pain to the infant and the anesthesia does not block all the pain that an infant feels. In 1993, a ban was formed against genital cutting of infant females. Under the law the ban should also cover male infants too as the equal protection act states. It's time for all sexes to be protected from this barbaric practice.The National Organization of Restoring Men has information about Circumcision and Foreskin Restorationhttp://www.4eric.org/Penn & Teller on Circumcision Part 1 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLGcqPE7xu0Penn Says: Matching Penises http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yRFNciRUAkCircumcision Kills- Santa Monica http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVrkDyMKUCI Circumcision Kills http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jUoDNmRwpMAll the videos on user Bonobo3D YouTube channel which has this video Circumcision & Jewish Identity http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAQdM2CxY5c"	0|0|0|0|0|0

"Comment Hi There, In spite all my effort, I don’t expect any understanding or help from the other side regarding the English version of the article about Alexander Voytovych. Therefore if one insists on deleting this particular article then go ahead as it seems to me there is no room for democratic thinking on your website whatsoever. I’d like to add a few more words as my final statement. Wikipedia says:  “Sources may encompass published works in all forms and media, and in any language. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability. The art works and art life of the artist is the sourcefor academic press, Ukrainian media, academic institutions, as well as poets, writers and publications use his paintings & drawings to illustrate books. The artist takes a part in a busy art life in the Ukraine presenting a number of exhibitions & art projects. Having said that I see that there is no enough evidence for one?????

If one convinced that the article has to be deleted, than do not hesitate to do so, but before that please give me a straight answer to my question. What is the difference between the article about Alexander Voytovych and, for example, the Herb Roe’s article, why the mentioned article is considered more accurate? I must highlight once again that instead of explaining what has to be changed or corrected on the page, one awards us with thenoticeboards. Regarding self-promotion  which was mentioned a few times I’d like to make it clear  the artists is a Ukrainian and naturally all sources are Ukrainian, and if the mentioned language is unknown to one it doesn’t meant that it allows one doubts the genuine sources. The Ukrainian and Russian versions of Wikipedia have accepted the article and honoured it, which says a lot.I had in my mind to present more Ukrainian artist, however having such an experience; I’d rather leave this business behind thanks to you. Thanks for co-operation. From my point of view this discussion is exceeded, feel free to delete the article!  "	0|0|0|0|0|0

"Balance==I find the balance of content in this article extremely unsatisfactory.  To introduce Badoglio's career by saying he ""was an Italian soldier, politician and alleged war criminal for the use of poison gas and systematically bombarding and strafing Red Cross hospitals and ambulances during the Ethiopia campaign. Due to post-war expediencies, however, he was never brought to justice"" seems to miss several points entirely.  That's 5 words about his military and political career, and 36 about his activities as a war criminal.  The war criminal accusation is based entirely on one documentary source which is very short on facts and evidence.  If this war criminal accusation is true, it needs to be strengthened with names, dates and places, and some evidence of Badoglio's involvement in the events.  It seems to me far more important to stress the facts that Badoglio was one of Italy's most senior military figures during the Second World War, despite his doubts about Italy's strategic capabilities, and that he became Prime Minister after the downfall of Mussolini.  Badoglio's role in the inexplicable two months delay between July and September 1943, when Italy's future role in the war remained ambivalent while Germany rushed troops south to fortify the Italian peninsula, is the most fascinating thing about his career.  Whatever the reasons for his failure to act decisively, Badoglio's inaction condemned Italy to suffer another twenty months of grinding war.  This article in its present form barely mentions those events.    =="	0|0|0|0|0|0

Article Evaluation  Article Evaluation For this assignment, I was tasked to analyze and comment on the article about Change Management. The first paragraph includes useful and clear overview of the topic, however, it could use a little more information that would broaden the interests of readers. They key points in this article are based on historical occurrences that have contributed to rapid changing events in the workforce and that also created a standard for change management in a way. The information includes sufficient information regarding the history and the context of this topic. It most definitely covers a variety of topics, including the reasons for such change. In addition to that, the article addresses the key issues including globalization and technology that have heavily influenced change management. There is therefore well supported evidence throughout the article and the analysis of certain models proves that the article is referenced and can be proven with contextual information. The article itself has a clear focus on a topic and also includes detailed scholarly support throughout the text, which can be found in the reference section. The contribution considers a variety of perspectives, however, I think it primarily focuses on today’s rapidly changing world, in reference towards globalization and technology and maybe could focus more than just a few scholars. It takes an appropriate tone in providing points of view in the context of globalization and technology and is supported with appropriate references throughout the page. I think for this article there are sufficient references but more references can always be beneficial and offer more content. The article represents a neutral point of view but in a way is sort of drawn towards today’s issues in terms of globalization and technology and offers a certain point of view. It does a good job staying with the facts and avoiding opinions. In terms of article length, the only thing I would suggest is a longer intro with a little more information for the reader to have. Overall, it’s a well written entry with detailed information about change management. I couldn’t find any grammatical errors or any misspellings and the text itself reads well and expresses good ideas. In terms of structure, I would only add more information to the introduction to give the reader more background knowledge.	0|0|0|0|0|0

"=Wolfram===A hypothetic body that completely absorbs all wavelengths of thermal radiation incident on it. Such bodies do not reflect light, and therefore appear black if their temperatures are low enough so as not to be self-luminous. All blackbodies heated to a given temperature emit thermal radiation with the same spectrum, as required by arguments of classical physics involving thermal equilibrium. However, the distribution of blackbody radiation as a function of wavelength, known as the Planck law, cannot be predicted using classical physics. This fact was the first motivating force behind the development of quantum mechanics.  Wolfram - Referenced to Eisberg, R. and Resnick, R.

The Table of Sacrifices is an artifact summoned by the Three Sacks in order to raise the Yamiking (and likewise, Hydrate) to the surface.  Typically, a being from the Reverse Maruhage can only individually teleport back and forth between dimensions (we see when Crimson, LOVE and the Sacks return to the Dark World, they use a teleporter that allows them to raise and fall between the surface).  My assumption is that an object such as the Yamiking needs a lot of energy to rise up to the main world compared to the limited amount of energy that individuals can use.  Thus, the Table of Sacrifices is needed to gather energy from twelve individuals (in the form of a clock) to power the Yamiking.  After the Sacks summon the clock, Crimson and LOVE throw over defeated opponents (already known to be really strong since they made it to the final stage of the playoff) into each number, with the assumption that their great energy will siphon from the clock to the Yamiking. -	0|0|0|0|0|0

Mr. Rutherford has made no attempt to answer here about his deletion of sourced content whose veracity is as strong or stronger than what User:Mikenorton (above) assesses as 'reliable sources' (i.e. Orey, Cal (2006) book as source material.) [gleefully he wrote above: ""That's much better - I can actually see the wood for the trees now.""]  In addition, by implication User:Mikenorton is implying that wikipedia articles themselves are unreliable (as sources).

What would you call this? Hope you are doing good. Sorry I do not want to waste your time. But this issue is out of my understanding. My contributions to the article Baloch people has be reverted again by long term editors. I do not understand, you can check the articles for example Pashtoon_people, Punjabi_people which the two Major ethnic groups around that region. And then Now when you look at the article Baloch people it can easily be seen that these people are a minority with massive land, they live under war and the illiteracy rate amongst them is around 80%. This is the reason the article Baloch people has not seen positive contributions even though it has been a while since Wikipedia was founded. I would not worry about it much but in this age information is a necessity and many people find Wikipedia as a source to gain knowledge. You may ignore this issue but I had to point it out some where.Thanks.	0|0|0|0|0|0

XENODONTLIKEIT Typically, when Xenophrenic sees a valid edit (by wiki policy) that he disapproves of (for whatever reason), he seeks to get others to remove it. This strategy is quite effective as he says the edit needs balance, or needs the proper context, or isn't the full story, etc. There are many different reasons used, but the end result is him adding so much trivial nonsense ( > 2 to 1 ratio in his POV) that average editors cringe when they see it. Xenophrenic then declares that the original unbalanced POV version can ONLY stay if his even more unbalanced additions are there to provide proper balance. This leads to edit warring over days and even weeks, articles often get locked down. Some reasonable and responsible editors step in and remove it all in the name of peace and to move forward in improving the article. Xenophrenic gets what he wanted all along, and boosts his edit count with the disruptive edit warring. Some call this tactic a form of wiki-terrorism, I say it shows that Xenophrenic is quite calculated and intelligent (not a terrorist), even though he is mostly obtuse during discussions.	0|0|0|0|0|0
" The Burke Group In response,  I never provided where he went to school.   I added  he is a J.D.    RAther than delete he is a J.D. (Juris Doctor)  then refer to him as Dr.  David Burke?  A J.D. is a Doctor of Jurisprudence same as a Ph.D.   Why do you allow personal information that's good for you but not for others who might be interested in knowing more?  He was important enough to post an article so why do you think any reader will be satisfied with a sum total of data saying  he owns a rental property in Agoura Hills with a meaningless political contribution?  The property posted is a rental  where he no longer lives and maybe never did.   How is that useful in an article about organized labour? You said it yourself the article should be about the company.  But in actual fact, he IS the company.    He's a flight instructor whom I know from our FBO (Flight Base Operation).  Lots of people know him.   He hasn't contributed to Republicans for years.  Look at the site you  provided!!  Last one was 2004.  Why continue to keep outdated useless information?  The article cited by Dr. John Logan, a very learned fellow, contains some useful info but also contains factually incorrect information. Even he can make mistakes.   I am a lawyer and Logan is a British economist, and may understand E.U. law but does not understand U.S. labor law.  Just because he writes about it does not mean he understands it.  There is NO newspaper article about CDN that says employees were awarded from the Court of Appeals.  He wrote incorrectly.    The citation provided which corrects his article  is  from the court dockets.  Which is a better citation?    I provided the citation from  the law firm that WON the civil case against CDN!!   I removed nothing  about the case itself.... only corrected the information in such a way that the non legal lay person could understand the fundamental differences between NLRB law and DOL law and civil actions filed with the District Courts.   What John Logan wrote that you cite is liking saying someone was cited by the F.A.A. but tried at the D.M.V.!!!  Are you British?  F.A.A. is Federal Aviation Admin. and D.M.V. is Dept. of Motor Vehicles.  They are not related anymore than NLRB is to District Court or civil cases..   Burke works in NLRB jurisdiction and the case you cite is a Civil Action in District Courts not related.    If you want CDN  discussed,  first part is fine but the civil action is not.  there should be another topic developed in wikipedia for CDN.    Logan's article  used as a citation  lacks any credible legal citation connecting Burke to the civil case.   Only a legal citation should be used.   There are none available.    DJB is a very well known person and lots of lawyers both company and union know him. No matter which side of the aisle...this information is flawed.    If you are going to discuss legal issues then get them right.  Am I being picky?  Yes.  Inside the law you can't just throw something at the ceiling and hope it sticks.   Deleting FACTS for FICTION is beneath the dignity of what Wikipedia has strived to promote.    Why do you say the article contains everything anyone needs to know to justify deleting contributions?   How is that possible when Wikipedia is an opened forum for knowledgeable people to build and add more?  You think the sum total for the reader should be that Burke owns a rental property in Agoura HIlls?  How is that related to THe Burke Group?  Please stop  the generalities and provide  3 facts I contributed and tell me EXACTLY how the citation or ""tone"" can be improved and let me do that.  Also, please define what is meant by ""tone"".

Abuse Hello, I was recently banned and then rebanned for a fortnight and then banned from contacting others or even writing on my own talk page.  I feel that serious abuses have occurred and my account clearly shows who was abusing their tools.  The final block of me being able to even write on my own talk page about how I was blocked unjustly and the inherent problems that I could spot in the process really took the cake and I think that moderator named Tarc (but the others too) need to be seriously reprimanded and even stripped of their tools because this was serious abuse of power and it was taken to an excessive level that shows clear abuse I think.  Can you please advise me on what to do to follow up on this because I believe this is of the highest importance to wikipedia integrity. Thank you.    JohnHistory	0|0|0|0|0|0

There's no bright line here. Like a lot of things, you only know you've gone too far when you've gone too far.

Perhaps things are different in your part of the country but in my experience, every restaurant or bar that sells wine, sells it by the glass.

" March 2012 (UTC)""That sentence assumed that there was wrongdoing. The rest of that section still implies it by the juxtaposition of the funding information with the report details. You may think that this is obvious, but we need a source that explicitly states that the findings of the the UT report were influenced by the funding received.""Perhaps personal correspondence with the authors of the Texas study admitting their findings were indeed swayed by the knowledge that the business interests of major donors to their institution and research programmes would likely be substantially affected in the negative if said findings did not produce a clean bill of health for fracking? I mean, that's about the only way you could ever meet your demand. What an utterly absurd request. It's easy to see why it was made, though: just set the bar so high it can't be jumped, then use the failure as an excuse to chop out what you don't like. Maybe you'd have me hack the e-mail accounts of the authors, fish around for evidence (assuming there is even any there), then leak it to a major newspaper so they can write an article that I can cite on here. Only the most naive idiot can fail see the potential for conflict of interest from a study put out by Texas. The university's state is the heart and soul of US oil & gas, but that's certainly not worthy of so much as a mention given that which is also true: the university has multi-million-dollar and other links with the largest provider of fracking services in the United States, not to mention other oil & gas companies with interests in fracking. I have no idea whether their report was swayed by industry links, but only a fool would suggest the potential isn't there. If you don't like the juxtaposition, just open up a gap with a caveat—and make it as weak, pathetic and denigrating as you like for all I care, maybe something like, ""socialist—nay, communist!—campaigners in the pay of a European Maoist group have alleged a potential for a conflict of interest, noting that..."" For comparison, take the recent global-warming sceptics at the Heartland Institute: as soon as details of the Institute's funding were leaked, they were prominently reported in the press. We don't even need leaks here, the information is freely available to anyone who takes the time to find it out, as Smm201`0 and others have done. All you are interested in doing is eliminating even mention of perfectly obvious potential for conflict of interest. According to Ian Urbina, we can't even get a decent, untarnished report out of the EPA; unlike Texas, the EPA doesn't even take industry funding, for god's sake, yet still it can't escape heavy industry pressure to redact. Aside from irrelevances like minor earthquakes, I have no idea whether fracking is causing all the problems it is alleged to, though I am extremely suspicious given the documented efforts of industry (and their paid-for puppets in government) to tone down or eliminate negative findings, and the truly just ridiculous claims about fracking's potential by people like Lord Browne here in England. And I couldn't care less if fracking's safe or not. Why should I? or anyone? If it's not, it's not; if it is... it is! Outside of a lunatic asylum, who would care? If it is safe (enough), bring it on: jobs, tax receipts, increased energy security, reduced use of coal burning... only a fool wouldn't be interested in those things, particularly given the current economic situation. What I don't like are those desperate only to hear what they want to hear making up totally unreasonable tests so they can get rid of what they regard as offending material.~   00:59, 28"	0|0|0|0|0|0
Sure they're subjective - they're rhetorical: I was arguing a case. I still think that the single arrival point (article to which all others direct) should be the most neutral. I believe that that, when dealing with periods in the past, should be assumed to be the title used in the subject's own time (necessarily adjusted for the English language, in an E Lang encyclopedia) - here, Philip the Tetrarch. The Herod Philips have to be there, because people will search for them. These pages should note that there is disagreement about the use of the name and that there is very little firm evidence surviving from that time, and then send the seeker to the historical name. If someone with more knowledge than my own adds a note to the effect that 'Theologians use ... and historians use ...', that would be a welcome addition. This means that all the terms would be in wikipedia; they would all be findable; and there would be a central page which would contain all relevant information, and I trust everything that any user of an encyclopedia might want. I don't want to MOVE any pages, just tidy up the way of finding them. I don't think this is as strong an advice as you do; more of a signpost (perhaps a better image than 'guide'?) In particular, I was astonished, when I began this, by the confusion over HP I & HP II. Evidence for the elder 'Philip' seems minimal.	0|0|0|0|0|0

I dropped by to update you on the current situation with the content review workshop, which you contributed to for a while.  We have a proposal for automation of peer review, and it seems  is going to try to find time to write the bot code for that.  Once he has something to show people we'll post more notifications so people can see what they think of the idea.Since it will be some time before Gimmetrow gets to that, we're currently running another straw poll to identify the next topic, and I thought that you might be interested in participating in that, even if you decide not to get involved with the subsequent topic discussion.

"""List of United States cities by area"" says Sitka, Alaska, has 4,812 square miles, of which 2,874 are land; Juneau, Alaska, has 3,255 square miles, of which 2,717 are land; Anchorage, Alaska, has 1,961 square miles, of which 1,697 are land; and Jacksonville, Florida, has 874 square miles, of which 758 are land.""List of cities by surface area"" matches that, except that it mentions ""Juneau City and Borough"".The pages about those four individual cities today have figures that match, too. Yet, when I posted in this section several days ago, the article on Jacksonville said 1,962.4 square miles.Jacksonville's own government website says it has 841 square miles, not 874 or 758.I'm not sure whether some people or governments are rightly or wrongly putting all of a county's land into the city's listed area. I can say that, in the case of Jacksonville, although the governments of the (a) City of Jacksonville and (b) Duval County are unified, there is (or ought to be) separate reckoning of the city's and county's area, because Duval County also contains three other cities (Jacksonville Beach, Atlantic Beach, and Neptune Beach), which are not part of the City of Jacksonville (they have their own, separate police departments, for example—even though the Jacksonville Public Library is county-wide).The government website of the City and Borough of Juneau says it has 2,593.6 square miles of land and 487.6 square miles of water, for a total of 3,081.2 square miles. Neither the total nor the land area there matches what Wikipedia gives.At the government website of the City and Borough of Sitka, I haven't found the area.Same for the government website of Anchorage. But it does link to anchorage.net, which says the city has 1,955 square miles—which, like the government figures for Jacksonville and Juneau, doesn't match Wikipedia's figure. "	0|0|0|0|0|0

I can't get into the specific details(that's an entirely different topic), but I can tell you that the entire mall has been a money loser for several years now.  Cambridge Shopping Centers has placed it up for sale time and time again.  Nobody wants it, and I don't blame them.  If Sears ever decides to pull out of there, they might as shut the entire place down and bulldoze it, because the land is worth more than the mall itself.  Everything is going Northside anyway.  Downtown Chatham has been a cesspool ever since the recession of the 90's, and it never fully recovered.  And the Capitol Theatre? Give me a break.  They might as well give up on that too.  It's been what? Over ten years now, and after all the time and money that was pissed away on that thing, we stil aren't any closer to it being finished, or having a final completion date.  As far as Chatham as a city goes, I have never seen so many unsavoury, shady people in my life.  Not everyone is like that, I agree, but yes it would seem as though Chatham does qualify as the welfare capitol on Ontario.  Drugs, unwed mothers, crackheads, dropouts, second and third generation ""welfare families"", a plethora of health problems, and well you get the pitcure.

My twopenn'orth is that it is probably better to say Apartheid in terms of South Africa, but in Rhodesia one should prefer the term 'European' and 'African'. This doesn't imply that the governments were directed by Europe, merely that they were composed of people who were descended from European settlers. This was the accepted term used at the time. Rhodesia did not have an Apartheid system; it was at times suggested, but ruled out as impractical. .  fys aym.	0|0|0|0|0|0

Well, I am not goint to stay, it simply to much of a waste of time, maybe I will check back in in a few years, and I would be happy to provide reading recommendations for anyone who asks me. (It would not be hard to find my real e-mail address using the information about me you already know). But I will take up this last discussion because of your specific invitation. The Tangut did not speak Chinese, they spoke their own language. The official name of their land in their own language has been written about by Ksenia Kepping and is available on a link from the Tangut Language page. In no case was Xia there autonym. It was something like Minyag which is waht they are called in Tibetan. In general I have a big chip on my sholder about Sinologists becomming confucian literati. The Yuan, and Qing were no more Chinese than I am. To use Chinese names for these political entities is to take for granted the medieval Chinese worldview. While now it is indeed true that the PRC owns a big chunk of Asia how much of it is actually historically China?The Jurchen's, Kitans, Tangut, Mongols, Tibetans, Nanchao, Azha (Tüyühün) were their own countries with their own languages and customs. Tangut history is relevant to Chinese history in the way that French history is relevant to English history, but also vice versa. To have a thing on the article saying 'this article is part of the section Chinese History' reinforces the view that the Tangut's don't deserve their own history. There is a sociological fact about Western academia that Sinology is big and well funded, while Tangutology, Nanchaology, Kitanology etc. are all virtually nonexistant. But this is a fact about us, and not about the history of Central/East Asia.	0|0|0|0|0|0

Gilad Atzmon article and incessent POV vandalism How DARE you put this notice on my talkpage: +  simply for my efforts to add some responsible balance to the article on Gilad Atzmon which now reads as a unadorned love letter to - i.e. WHITEWASH of - a performer with profoundly racist and fascistic views.  Atzmon's groupies on this board - such as Felix-Felix and Edna Spennato (a close personal friend of Atzmon) have been relentlessly censoring and reverting all the documented evidence that puts their hero in a less than fully flattering light. It is therefore THEY who are the major perpetrators of POV Vandalism to that page. Your hideous targeting of ME - a dedicated anti-racist and anti-fascist activist - shows either complete ignorance on your part or a bias that ultimately enables Nazi racists attempting genocide.

"I'm not talking about belief of majority. In fact I would presume a billion Muslims specifically state he did not claim to be God and many of other faiths would agree. I'm saying I don't think we have any facts to solidly state, by encyclopedia standards, whether Jesus claimed to be a god or not. You can object because it's unclear, but your statement ""he did not claim he was god"" is merely your opinion. You really can't prove it. Considering the historical effect in least the concept he claimed to be god I think may make it relevant here, but I could see taking it off as disputed. Although if you want to get into it in many books I've read indicate Hong Xiuquan did not claim to be God either. He believed that Jesus was the Son of God, but not God. He had an Arian view of Jesus and of his own role as ""Son of God."" Although I added her it sounds possible that this MITA woman only believed she contained the Holy Spirit rather then ""was the Holy Spirit."" Yet you don't object on those or ones that may even be more debatable. In least in the case of Jesus the idea he claimed to be God is the mainstream belief of his followers and the existent writing on him. "	0|0|0|0|0|0

If there is something about ADD in there, it must in some kind of code that my old ass can't decipher, but I heard no such admission. As for using YouTube as a source, I wouldn't accept it as one. I don't know if there is a policy about YouTube not being used, but I tend to replace YouTube links anyway because they are forever removing videos and if something is true and noteworthy, there would be more than just a video source. In this case, I found nothing else to back up the ADD claim. Perhaps the person who wants to include it should give find a secondary source because the one provided doesn't back up the content.

" Vienna Dude, seriously.  WP:RS and WP:V don't get thrown out the window just because Mary Jo Foley of microsoft-watch.com provides an unattributable and unverifiable quote from a so-called ""spokesman"" about the change in name.  Nobody at Microsoft with a name has bothered to come out and say ""Yes, the name is Vienna"" in the last few days.  Doesn't that strike you as somewhat odd?  We can trace back the origin of almost every other recent code name to a blog entry by a developer team, or a page on Microsoft's web site.  Not this time.  I'm not going to bother with renaming back to Windows Blackcomb, since you'll probably change it back to Vienna without bothering with that nagging Wikipedia requirement of verifiability.  This isn't a race.  Okay... What's the point of these constant reverts back to Blackcomb? I'm really sure now that the codename is ""Vienna"". The change was recent, let's not make a big deal of it not being mentioned everywhere. No offense, but you seem to like the name Blackcomb much better than Vienna. Get over it. It was changed. Now it wasn't only Scoble who confirmed it. My guess is they were trying to keep it secret for some reason. Several sources claim it's ""Vienna"", so let's keep it that way. There were rumours about ""Longhorn"" being changed to ""Vista"", but later it was confirmed. Let's just leave the article alone for right now. —  "	0|0|0|0|0|0

"OK, no reordering. But can we give them designations, like this? I'm calling it ""List A"" so we can start a new list later without confusion. If you don't like it we'll work something else out, but we really need some way to refer to issues without saying, ""Hey, getting back to that thing we were talking about, the bit where it says that Gage was traveling, not the bit about the time when he blah blah blah.""One point: we absolutely cannot refer to ""Note X"" and ""Ref 22"" and so on. These designations shift around as the article is edited and we will go completely crazy. In the below, I've substituted permalinks instead. Issues list ""A""A1 BackgroundA1a ""He may have gained skill with explosives on his family's farms or in nearby mines and quarries..."" Speculation from Macmillan. Attribute it.A1b Gage's date of birth in the infobox is not covered here when it should be covered and noted in proper context of its sourcing.A2 Gage's accidentA2a Does not address numerous theories presented or Gage's actions prior to accident. EEng knows all too well this subject. I think Ratiu and Van Horn's material needs to be pointed out because the evidence shows that Gage had his mouth open and was speaking at the time the rod passed through his skull. I do not know why this is absent. I have issues with the section, but I'll hold off on the excessive quoting and measurement issues for now.A3 Subsequent life and travelsA3a ""bt. February he was able to do a little work abt. ye horses & barn, feedg. ye cattle &c; that as ye time for ploughing came he was able to do half a days work after that & bore it well."" - Paraphrase.A3b  Would Gage's mental impairment belong here? I think it would be helpful.A3c  Missing Gage's time in New Hampshire prior to Chile.A3d  Chile and California is missing the account of Gage's doctor and missing some other tidbits, not too bad - but everything related to his mental improvement and the regaining of normalcy in his life is absent without reason.A3e This is also the key section that Macmillan's research becomes quite useful as a case argument.A4 Death and subsequent travelsA4a  Still glaringly missing the details surrounding his return home, illness and death. A4b Also, the exhumation details - which was in Fleischman's book - is entirely absent. This little episode in the Gage story is something which is important. A5 Other mattersA5a Analysis and actual examination of the claims and details surrounding Gage and his role in science has been well- mostly avoided by the article.

"Requests for commentI've echoed the suggestions of Mackensen and others that you take this to Wikipedia:Requests for comment.  Your most recent reply on Mackensen's talk page is: I could, but I think Arbcom should accept the case with or without an RfC. There's too much misconduct to willfully ignore. Besides, you're only asking me to do that to delay the inevitable, why would I ever take that advice?There are several problems with this response: Firstly a number of other editors have asked you to go through RfC: , the  closer or the first Articles for deletion discussion, , who as far as I can tell played no part in earlier discussions,  who also seems to have been absent from earlier discussions, and , an arbitrator who in rejecting the case said ""If you can't be bothered with an RfC then we can't be bothered with an arbitration case.""  has also remarked on your failure to follow process here. Again you allege misconduct, on a scale too great ""to wilfully ignore"".  If there appears to be such a level of misconduct and yet the arbitrators can't see it, it looks like you'll have to make it more apparent to them.But finally, despite all the others including arbitrators who have asked you to go to RfC, you say that I in particular am only asking you to go to RfC ""to delay the inevitable"".  Well I'm not sure that you and I can agree on what ""the inevitable"" is in this case.  To my eyes this looks a case on which you really wouldn't like to hear what the arbitrators have to say, and they've hinted on this in their comments on the case.  But since they're obviously not going to accept the case until you've at least made an honest attempt to conduct some intermediate steps in dispute resolution, I'm urging you to do so.  If an arbitration case follows, the sooner the better as far as I'm concerned, so get cracking. Tony Sidaway "	0|0|0|0|0|0

"Dear Michael, thanks for your comment. I made the comment about the old version of the article almost exactly 3 years ago, see the version at that time: . It said ""Einstein–Cartan theory in theoretical physics extends general relativity, to handle spin angular momentum correctly."" at the very beginning and the whole article was written in the spirit of the claim that general relativity (without extensions) describes the spin incorrectly. As far as I can read, this is no longer claimed by the article. Einstein-Cartan theory is a historically important extension of general relativity, with some extra fields (torsion), but all the modern evidence indicates that such extra fields don't exist - and they're not needed. If you care about sociology, no research of cosmology or calculations of NASA's experiments or anything of the sort takes the ""torsion field"" into account because the latter doesn't exist, as far as the existing evidence - theoretical or experimental - can say. Today, it's not an important proposal to extend GR. The new article doesn't make these points too clear but at least it also no longer makes crazy claims throughout the text that general relativity (without torsion) is inconsistent with the spin, or something like that, so I wouldn't protest against the new version. Visually, it surely looks like a well-written article. However, I see some confusion in your comment that does show that the articles doesn't explain the basic points too clearly. Einstein-Cartan theory is not ""just"" about the tetrads. Tetrads are indeed useful - and in some formal sense necessary - to describe spin in General Relativity. However, using the tetrads formalism is not yet Einstein-Cartan theory. Einstein-Cartan theory assumes that ""torsion"" may be nonzero - even though it is identically zero in general relativity (which normally uses the metric). One can write GR in terms of tetrads as well - and the torsion is still zero. If that's so, one isn't doing Einstein-Cartan theory.   "	0|0|0|0|0|0
In 1988 a Wide Use Campaign was introduced by republican senator, Mark Hatfield. The Wide Use Campaign supported unrestricted access to timber and other resources. Wise Use activists exploited the population’s fear of job and property security loss. The Campaign placed a barrier between workers and environmentalists. The Wide Use Campaign used bumper stickers, phone-ins and faxes to promote their views. Wise Use and Republicans kicked off anti-environmentalism.The recession that began in 1990 enhanced anti-green and pro-industry views. A group called Alliance for America was created with 125 anti-environment and pro-industry groups. In 1994, the US did not pass a Biodiversity Treaty.  Another group that was created in the 90’s was called Earth Day Alternatives. They were also counter-environmentalists. This group labelled environmentalists as “anti-human” and extremists.  The Earth Day Alternative group promoted three things. They aimed to privatise resources for exploitation, advocate pollution to be permitted as trade between companies, to discredit environmental science. Heritage was a group that was also created with a laissez-faire approach toward the environment. Anti-environmentalists were motivated by the fact that the ICI created deceptive green advertising.	0|0|0|0|0|0

"Mentioning Darwin gave up natural selection and became a LamarckianThe article currently makes no mention of the historically important fact that Darwin himself converted from the natural selection theory of evolution to a Lamarckian environmentalist position in later editions of The Origin of Species, which went into 6 different editions by 1872. Hence I propose the following insert at the first Darwin quotation in the current section ‘Publication of the theory of natural selection’, which I also propose should be retitled ‘Publication of the Darwin’s theory of evolution’.Proposed insert:'However,  even in the first edition of his book Darwin only claimed natural selection was the main means of selection, but not the only one. In the last sentence of its Introduction he said “Furthermore, I am convinced that natural selection has been the main but not exclusive means of modification.”But by 1872 he had published six editions of the book with corrections and revisions, and in later editions in response to criticism of his theory of inheritance Darwin even gave up the theory of natural selection as the main selector of evolution, with its strong principle of inheritance, in favour of Lamarckian environmentalism, with a changing environment as the main selector. As C.D. Darlington wrote in 1950 in his Foreword to a new and first reprint of the otherwise unavailable first edition of The Origin:""Let no one imagine, however, that, in the world of science, Darwin's theory has enjoyed an unchequered prosperity. On the contrary the dust of battle is only now beginning to settle on the hotly disputed ground....The most abiding source of trouble was that discovered  by the Professor of Engineering at Edinburgh. Professor Fleming[sic] Jenkin pointed out in 1867, that any new variation appearing in one individual would be lost or swamped in later generations when that individual was compelled to cross with others of the old and established type, and its differences, as Darwin believed, blended in inheritance. Nature would never be able to keep any differences to select. Darwin's defence against this objection was already prepared. He had hinted it in the first edition of The Origin of Species: at the end of the Introduction he had said that ""Natural Selection has been the main but not exclusive means of modification."" In later editions he hedged further. He fell  back on the other means. These depended chiefly on the action of a changing environment: its direct effect in altering living things so as to suit it must be inherited. In adopting this view Darwin was giving up his own, and Wallace's, peculiar claim to originality: he was giving up the argument implied in the title of the book: and he was falling back on the discarded and disreputable theory of Lamarck."" [p. xvii On the Origin of Species by means of Natural Selection first edition reprint in The Thinker's Library by Watts & Co, 1950.] 'But Darlington failed to establish Lamarck's theory was discarded or disreputable. In fact the theory of natural selection only became accepted in the mid-20th century with the ‘Mendelian-Darwinian synthesis’ in population genetics. But even by 1950 Darwinism was still not accepted in academia according to Darlington:""In view of the triumph of his ideas it might be thought that Darwinism, in all civilised countries, would be taught as one of the foundations of thought, that in the universities everywhere it would be critically expounded and experimentally developed. That is true of its remote and general applications to such sciences as astronomy and geology. But where, as in its applications to ourselves, in the study of the genetics of men, and to the histories of nations, as exact knowledge of the principles of variation, hybridization and selection is required, we hear on every side nothing but confused and ignorant speculations. At the same time the foundation of Darwinism in the experimental study of evolution has largely been smothered in Darwin's own country. The Universities, with their museums and botanic gardens, are happy to forget what, in 1859, they were unable to resist. They contain no memorial of his work,  and all the means of developing his doctrine they frustrate by an arrangement of teaching which the theory of evolution is not allowed to disturb. The old pedantic learning of botany and zoology, which Darwin treated as one subject, they continue to cleave asunder, burying the halves under their ancient schedules of instruction."" [‘’ibid’’ pxviii-xix].

" Spventi: ""but perhaps it's safest to discuss your concerns before making arbitrary changes."" - Indeedly. Sorry for my thoughtlessness.I have no intention to suggest a change from ""nakashite"" to ""nakasete,"" but would feel better if ""miseyo"" is changed to ""miseu"" or ""miseyou"" because みせよ cannot be an expression of volition.The version in Spventi referred is modernized in wording, and both of the two sources say it was written by 松浦靜山, I would say みせう is the original. Plus, the explanation 「松浦靜山の『甲子夜話』にみえる川柳。おそらくはよみ人知らず」 sounds much more reliable than 「江戸後期の平戸藩主・松浦静山が詠んだ句」. Then, みせよう should be a more adequate modern Japanese word here than みよう. I suspect that it might be a typo or mistranslation. Now, here is a third source; a text book for junior-high ISBN 4-594-03155-2, in which the one for Hideyoshi is written as 鳴かぬなら鳴かしてみせようほととぎす. Spventi: ""then the onus is on you to provide information that suggests otherwise."" - Indeedly. But I can't find an english word to express hototogisu. That is why I questioned. It is a family of cuckoo, but smaller. And it really sings. A popular bird next to uguisu who tells you the spring has come, while hototogisu being the one for the summer. Here is an illustration. I was not suggesting to change the word, but just asking whether there was a better word to be used here. If not, it can stay as it is.Spventi: ""your concern about the word ""coax"" is entirely misplaced."" and Jim_Lockhart: ""I think coax is fine for saying that"" - Hmmm. I withdraw. I trust you two than my dictionaries. One comment to Jim_Lockhart. Yes, he used flattery when necessary, especially in his early times, and I don't think it gives a negative feeling by describing him that way. That was not my worry. What I wanted to say was that it is only one face of him. You wrote ""resourseful as he was"", agreed.Now that I accepted the word coax and the form without first person, I admit Spventi's saying ""the changes you made to the English versions of the senryu were clearly not improvements."" Sorry again. One last question:  don't you feel like making some mutial reference between this section and Toyotomi_Hideyoshi#Cultural_point_of_interest? "	0|0|0|0|0|0

"But, the resulting view seems to imply bias in your preceding considerations. For instance, you've assumed I wanted Roux gone, when there's never been any such expressed desire from me, either im- or explicitly, neither before nor now. It also seems that you've excused Roux for some of the behaviour you admonish me for (not to say I feel I should be excused from anything I've done).If I may express my opinion, Roux is a good editor, but generally only when working alone or without opposition or critique; yes, I bare my own biases, but I come to that conclusion having seen his interactions with others in addition to my own experiences, and recent events seem to show that it isn't changing. It is my sense that in these circumstances he genuinely believes himself to be a victim, and, seemingly sensing some threat, responds to the most gentle criticism with the most vicious vitriol. While that can cause some problem in itself, the preverbal shit hits the fan when thrown into the mix are stubborn individuals who don't buy his claims of innocence and casualty, after which the intensity of the conflict increases exponentially. If it wasn't already obvious: I am one of those stubborn persons, believing we alone are responsible for our own actions. Thus, I honestly don't for one minute buy that Roux was ""driven"" to do anything; he chose to participate here in the manners that he did, both good and bad, and he chose to leave; just as I chose to participate in the manners that I did, chose to leave, chose to come back, chose to leave again, chose to come back, and choose to admit much of my editing habits were the wrong way to go about things. I like the idea of Roux no longer being an obstacle, but do not feel comfortable about the way in which it came to be; I'm not sure that anybody's actually won in this case.   "	0|0|0|0|0|0

Firstly, this is a first level national subcategory that it standard issue for every country in the world above the level of a microstate, and such categories should NEVER be deleted. It should have been fixed instead. Secondly, it is was empty, I suspect you have played into the hands of someone who takes a non-neutral stance on the Burma/Myanmar naming issue, and has abused process by emptying the category without following due process on Wikipedia:Categories for discussion. I will be correcting your error later today when I have time.   Actually, the discussion at the CFD you mentioned does seem to have clear concensus (no opposes, in fact), and this was just one of SEVERAL myanmar->burma categories that I deleted.  Another user has removed all the articles from these categories and (I suppose) placed them into new categories as described in the CFD.

Given that you don't provide any actual content, but seem to spend all your time formatting articles  and reverting people, I suppose  I oughtn't expect you to understand that the vast majority of content on wikipedia starts off unsourced.  Wikipedia moves forward by sourcing unsourced material, not by removing it.  It certainly doesn't move forward by removing trivially verifiable information, like my Niger-Congo languages edit that you reverted, in which I merely added a statement that most of the languages of central, southern, and eastern Africa are Bantu.  (I apologize for the vulgar edit summary in my revert. I was irritated.  I stand by the contention made there that it was a total WP:POINT violation. )	0|0|0|0|0|0

"==Ongoing issue==Several editors have expressed concern at your edits to the Spirit of St. Louis article. Reviewing the case, I agree that the edit seriously skews the statement to a non-neutral point of view. The difference between ""first"" and ""first solo"" is a very major one, IMHO, and cannot be allowed into the article as-is. Alcock and Brown clearly make the first non-stop flight, by removing the word ""solo"" you are creating a false statement in the article. This is a serious problem.I see several attempts to discuss the matter both here on your talk page and in the Talk:Spirit_of_St._Louis talk page, but I have seen no responses from you to date. This is another important wikipedia policy; change is fine, even radical change, but if it results in controversy you should address the concerns. Simply put, you have not done so.I don't want to harsh out here, but I do need to make sure the message is clear: unless you have a good explaination, and tell us what it is, any further edits to re-include this change will be treated as vandalism and result in a blocking of your editing privileges. If you really feel that this change is minor, and accurate, then you need to address the concerns brought forth by the other editors first. "	0|0|0|0|0|0

This is a farce: The Nervous Mermaid is wholly interested in Ralph Nader and has not commented on any other article in Wikipedia except for Seasons & a Muse, Inc, an article that has had only two contributors, one of whom, not coincidentally, is 76.166.123.129, who is often a commentator on the Ralph Nader article. Meanwhile, there's Telogen, who only comments on Ralph Nader and one other article, Jeanne Marie Spicuzza, an article which also happens to be visited extremely often by user 76.166.123.129. Would you guys cut this out?  The only evidence of conspiracy is that which you're creating. It appears there are several editors, myself included, who disagree with your position, so you're resorting to personal attacks. You're removing editors' contributions that are sourced and accurate. You're admittedly trolling these editors' histories, then attacking them, which is, by Wikipedia standards, bad faith. The fact is, I've contributed to various articles, some of which have existed for years. Conspiracy? Illuminati? No. Please stop the personal attacks.

2011 Report into Defence ProcurementI added a note on the publication of one of Carrie's reports, on a set of proposals for reform of certain aspects of defence procurement.  The note was removed on the basis that since he has written many such reports there was no need to single out one.  I didn;t know that, but I'm not convinced about this argument.  Firstlt, the report is, in itself, notable, since it later became the basis of a piece of legislation, which will affect  government spending of about £4Bn a year.  Secondly, would it not be better, rather than not mentioning any of his reports that have been commissioned by government, to try and list all of them?  I'm happy to do such a list.

Q1, no, because people searching for information on Barack Obama right now are not going to be searching for information about this with a greater than 90% probability. However as far as popular culture and the average citizen are concerned, this event IS john g roberts. anybody looking for information on him right now is almost certainly after it because of this event. and this event is how most americans will remember him. Q2, i doubt it, obama probably doesn't want to be reminded of that silly event. however its inclusion is not up to them as they are the interested parties...we are supposed to decide as objective editors. the fact remains this is the most significant well known even for which jgr will ever be known for. so it should be in the lead.	0|0|0|0|0|0

I think Alex had it planned from the beginning to form some sort of group page on a user space page to make it clear that we were working in a group.  Possibly having some sort of template on all of our user pages may be a good idea, as I am a wiki sysop for other websites, and I try to do things to minimize the look of conspiracy or sock puppetry.  I will remind everyone to keep as much communication as possible on this site, to prevent appearance of sock puppetry or conspiracy.  Also, just because you say you don't communicate with other users who come to your defense, highly conveniently, as I have been told, as there are many other ways to communicate off of this website; I keep this in mind when dealing with other users and policy on the websites I administrate.I think it's important to add that I don't agree with a lot of what Alex says, and that I'm not here to be a robot for her cause.  I may consider myself independent from her group for this reason.	0|0|0|0|0|0

" Editing of Anthony Hungerford Dear Phillip,               My comments regarding your editing of this site are not hostility, they are upset!I have only ever place three entries onto Wikipadia, and am the first to acknowledge that I have not made myself fully aware to the protocols of the site. After some 30 years of researching my ancestry, my primary aim was to share the information garnered on those few individuals who have been somewhat prominent in history.My upset comes from the fact that the editing was not sympathetic. You seem to have just wiped the article and started again. The upshot was that instead of leaving the information on the page [after all it has been there for some time-what is the rush to change it?] and asking for clarification, certain aspects just disappeared.If I understand it correctly, it seems that Wikipedia prefers to quote as a source from the Calendars of State Papers – because a contributor to DNB or ODNB [a secondary source] has seen it, and delete my other quote from the Calendar of State Papers with source reference-because I have seen it personally in a printed book of the Calendars?Likewise, as I mentioned to you in my email, it was obvious that the authors of both the old DNB and the ODNB did not actually know the origins of Colonel Hungerford-they both speculated. Whereas my later research had got nearer to the truth with my finding details given by Colonel Hungerford to the Ulster Herald, when he arrived in Ireland with his Regiment –which you confirmed with the full reference –•TABDublin: National Library of Ireland, Genealogical Office: Ms.45, pp.59-60: ""Certificate of Arms to Col. Anthony Hungerford of Marson in Wiltshire and his pedigree. He arrived with his Regiment in D]ublin, April 30, 1647.""•TABDublin: National Library of Ireland, Genealogical Office: Ms.45, p.62 Certificate of Arms and cadency to Ensign St. John Hungerford, third brother of and ensign to Col. Anthony Hungerford, May 12, 1647.I apologise if I have been too harsh in my comments to you, but you must understand that it was basic sourced information, which at the time was not on the internet, that I was seeking to share with Wikipedia readers, not style, rules and display.I hope you have not finished with your editing. If you require any further clarifications please contact me.212.140.128.142 "	0|0|0|0|0|0

Schulich School of Business Hello, Ckatz.  I wonder about consensus when Wikipedia also provides the following guidance: votes are not necessarily binding.  Have I mis-read something?

Senior editors should answer questions or refer people who want to know to the right place.  Let's act on principle.  I want to know if ranking MBA programmes, or any programme, constitutes a comercial activity.  It seems like marketing to me.  How about you?

Apologies for being slow getting back to you.It's a really hot day here in the UK after a series of hot days and my mind is not working clearly. I'm not sure what you're asking me. I think you're talking about Category:Beverage companies, and how breweries end up there. At some point that has been organised thus - Category:Beverage companies - Category:Alcoholic beverage companies - Category:Beer and breweries by region - Category:Beer and breweries in North America - Category:Beer and breweries in the United States - Category:Beer and breweries in Alabama. The brewing companies are contained within each ""Beer and breweries in Foo"" cat. What you are proposing is the same thing as already exists, but separating the companies from the brands at a low level, and then having two cats - one of products and one of companies, running side by side up the tree. What I am saying is that is not needed and is unwanted. We'd like to keep the beer and the brewery together in the same multi-purpose cat. Beer and brewery are often related. Bass and Heneiken, for example, refer both to product and company. Where possible we deal with both product and company in the same article, though with notable examples we will split off the product into its own standalone article.

Surtsicna has a very good point, and I wholeheartedly. New France was a colony. Colonies are not independent states and thus by definition don't have a Head of State, be it a President or a Monarch. Elizabeth II, for example, is not 'Queen of the Falkland Islands', because no such office exists and the Falklands are not an independent state. Francois Hollande is not 'President of French Guiana', because French Guiana is a French overseas department, and so on. Again; colonies cannot have a Head of State by definition!Canada after 1867 of course was not a colony, legally had a monarchy separate from that of the UK, and thus 1867 really should be the cut-off point.'Monarchs who ruled the country that was the colonial power that colonized Canada' is not the same thing as 'Monarchs of Canada'-including the French monarchs and the UK monarchs prior to 1867 makes as much sense as having a list of the British monarchs prior to 1776 on the page 'List of Presidents of the United States'	0|0|0|0|0|0

, 11 October 2009 (UTC)If I made some error, then why can't someone explain it to me on the Talk page? I am not pushing a POV.I edited an inflammatory sentence about a Jewish issue in the Schlafly biography page. I think that the sentence is anti-Jewish, but you may have your own opinion. Maybe you think the sentence is pro-Jewish. Either way, the sentence is contrary to WP BLP policy and must be removed immediately, unless it is reliably sourced.The source is a paragraph in a NY Times book review by a Jewish columnist. Schlafly did not write the book in question, and Schlafly is not Jewish. The book is not about Jews. The paragraph is not backed up by anything. The paragraph is partially explained by the fact that columnist is Jewish and likes to write about Jewish issues. The paragraph is a criticism of the book, and not a criticism of Schlafly.I think that the sentence is too unsupported and too far removed and too strange to even be included in an article about Schlafly. But if it is going to be there, then it should stick to what the NY Times columnist said. I believe that the sentence in dispute implies something about Schlafly that is not stated in the NY Times book review. That is what I argued on the Talk page, and no one rebutted that argument.Blocking me is just a way to put a false and defamatory allegation about a living person in a WP article. It is wrong, and those who put this Jew-related allegation in should be blocked, not me.   16:19	0|0|0|0|0|0

It's predominately an aerospace/vehicle engineering term.

"Exactly, Kelly knew what color her eyes were when she made the song ""Behind These Hazel Eyes"". Comparing the pictures of Kelly and Belle, they do seem to share the same eye color just slightly different shades of it - Belle's eyes are little lighter. Someone made a video called ""Behind Belle's Hazel Eyes"", the person who made this video knew what color Belle's eyes were and decided to include Belle's name in the title. And if you read the comments, the people fully agree her eyes are hazel with comments like ""green or hazel? they look more hazel than brown or green . yup belles﻿ eyes are deffinetely hazel problem solved"". I like the ""problem solved"" part. With Minotaurgirl's bias against the idea of Belle having hazel eyes, I think there will always be a problem with people like her involved.TV Tropes has already suffered an edit war because of her, so much so they forbade users from writting what Belle's eye color is. Notice how Belle's name is missing from the Eye Color tropes colony, while the rest of Disney Princesses have their eye color mentioned. Belle's name was there under the category of Hazel Eyes until Minotaurgirl came along and ruined it all. Same thing almost happened to Disney Wiki. This is Minotaurgirl's account, as you can see she got blocked with an expiry time of infinite, the reason; inserting false information, the false information being writting down Belle's eyes as brown.] And now here's Minotaurgirl on the Wikipedia. Is there any repsite from her?I noticed she has a Live Journal account. See what she has written. The lack of links speaks for itself. She thinks she actually proved Belle's eyes are brown, depsite the fact what she has presented as evidence is either a minority or a plain old lie, like the screenshots she send me. By magnifying the images, you can see her eyes are hazel-colored and not the same color as her hair at all. Notice how she's afriad to use close-ups of Belle's eye cuz she knows they'll appear hazel if she did so, thus disproving her. On her blog, she didn't mention that she was blocked on Disney Wiki, and said the only reason Disney Wiki kept Belle's eyes color as hazel was to shut up people who keep writting her eyes as hazel, when in reality the one who got shut up was Minotaurgirl as she got blocked while the others didn't. She wrote ""Bleh. Kids these days. This one needs a hobby. I'm tired of wasting time trying to undo this snot's damage, and I'm fairly sure the mods of these sites are too. Would it be possible to just...block this person off the internet entirely until they learn some manners?"" Yup, she calls people who use logic and legitimate evidence to prove their point snots and hobby-less kids if the evidence goes against what Minotaurgirl said/believes.If anyone deserves to be blocked, it's Minotaurgirl. If it wasn't for her bias, sites like like TV Tropes, Disney Wiki and the Wikipedia wouldn't have suffered an edit war about Belle's eye color. The fact that there was never an edit about Belle's eye color until Minotaurgirl came along, says a lot. Ever since she got blocked from Disney Wiki almost an year ago, no edit war about Belle's eye color happened there either. It's like Minotaurgirl is the only person on the entire internet who refuses to accept Belle's eyes as hazel and is willing to go to every page and change her eye color to brown, just cuz she likes to think so, not because the world thinks so or any legit evidence are presented. It's like someone going around changing Ariel's eyes from blue to green, just cuz he likes the idea of Ariel being green-eyed. Thinks don't work like that.My overall opinion on Minotaurgurl. I think it's safe to say the interent is better off without her. She's toxic, she's a nuisance, she's talks trash to people just cuz they disagree with her, she lies, she mangles, twists and misrepresents other people's words, and she causes edit wars. Action needs to be taken against people like this.  "	0|0|0|0|0|0

Thegreyanomaly, do people of south Asian origin like you practise polyandry, as in tibetan culture? How many dads do you have buddy? Tibetan culture like any other people's culture is fairly unique. If you south Asian people don't practise polyandry and don't allow your womenfolks to have more than one husband at the same time, then at least in this respect you south Asians don't share a similar culture to the tibetan folks. So don't tell us that tibetan culture is close to south Asian culture, because it isn't.	0|0|0|0|0|0

", you are correct about the ""авиа́ции"" word but wrong about lyotchik. In russia civil pilots a called ""пило́т"" (pilót), and military pilots are called ""лё́тчик"" (lyótchik), it is a military profession not a rank same as pilot not a rank in any military. Word ""солда́т"" (soldát) means soldier and used same way as in english. Word ""моря́к"" (moryák) in russian comes from word ""море́"" (moryé) meaning sea so in general speech it coul be translated as a seaman (even some online translaters do that) or as a sailor, but in military ranks important is the equevalency not the translation, and the equivalent to U.S. rank of seeman would be russian rank of matros, while moryak is general term which could applied to anybody who seves in navy or in a civil fleet.

Liam is a painstaking writer who is a reliable, honest, energetic, and above all, selfless champion of the underdog.  he has laboured to bring the torture carried out at ICC to light.  In view of the thanklessness of this task, and of your carping sarcasm.. I think he deserves credit as a first class journalist.you, on the other hand, write for a self-applauding group.  You have little, or no, experience of the wider world.  Safe in your little tower, you spit on those who actually risk something for their writing.People like you are the reason torture centres like ICC can operate.  Well done!  Well done!

While it is true that these are just guidelines, and that exceptions may exist where the person is notable in spite of not meeting any criterion, the case for notability nevertheless needs to be made. I’m not trying to prove that he isn’t notable, I’m trying to determine if he is.As far as I can see, the criteria are not met:1. The person's research has made significant impact in their scholarly discipline, broadly construed, as demonstrated by independent reliable sources.I’m not a fan of citation metrics, and they’re not the final word, but the h-index is 30, which is pretty average. The most cited paper does have over 300 citations, but that’s the moss genome sequence, where he’s one of many authors. Genome sequences always get lots of citations.2. The person has received a highly prestigious academic award or honor at a national or international level.This may be true, but the article does not mention it. I don’t think a Heisenberg fellowship counts as ‘highly prestigious.3. The person is or has been an elected member of a highly selective and prestigious scholarly society or association (e.g. a National Academy of Sciences or the Royal Society) or a Fellow of a major scholarly society for which that is a highly selective honor (e.g. the IEEE).Again this may be true, but isn’t mentioned in the article.4. The person's academic work has made a significant impact in the area of higher education, affecting a substantial number of academic institutions.No major textbooks or other examples of this are given in the article.5. The person holds or has held a named chair appointment or ""Distinguished Professor"" appointment at a major institution of higher education and research.No evidence for this is given in the article.6. The person has held a major highest-level elected or appointed academic post at a major academic institution or major academic society.From what I can see in the article, the highest position he has held was dean of the Faculty of Biology.7 The person has made substantial impact outside academia in their academic capacity.No evidence for this given in the article.8. The person is or has been the head or chief editor of a major well-established academic journal in their subject area.Only normal editorial board memberships given in the article.9. The person is in a field of literature (e.g writer or poet) or the fine arts (e.g. musician, composer, artist), and meets the standards for notability in that art, such as WP:CREATIVE or WP:MUSIC.Does not apply.If you can show that the criteria are met after all, I’m happy to go along with it, but just being a professor does not satisfy WP:PROF.

"Hey there buddy, I am back:(a quote from Kenneth Tennyson Phd.)""the sad thing is that our fellow here - freedom skies - appears to have been raised in america or britain and yet he seems more indian than american or british and along with that supports a radical view of the world that is peppered religious ideas... and along with that - he is educated! It is truly sad... if india industrializes and this hindutva movement holds sway, the world will see a flourishing of a very powerful and scary radicalized country.""Firstly, can you tell me what being American or British is? America and Britain are both made of of various immigrant and former immigrant communities from Italy, Ireland, China, Guatemala, and so forth. So, if Freedom Skies is being proud of his culture, is that evil? Secondly, you have an over negative estimation of countries outside of your clouded world. Suggestion, join the Marine Corps. That is one thing I have learned is understanding the world through travel. Thirdly, I am utterly shocked at your comment on Freedom skies being educated as being a sad thing (if not, a scary thing). Does that threaten you that Indians are educated? Please answer yes or no (no need to give a disertation or oration), thank you. Also, that statement reminds me of when the slaveowners back in the Southern part of America during the civil war used to consider Blacks getting education as a threat to their lifestyle. As a matter of fact, it was illegal for an Afro-American to go to school or even learn to read, since it was viewed as a threat to the racist slave owners. I will even go a further step to say that back then, these racists from the colonial South felt threatened that the slaves would become ""a very powerful and scary radicalized community"".  Regarding your previous posts, here is some food for thought. In the Marine Corps, as a Gunny Sgt. or someone in command, if you are at a bar or a party, you never show that you are drunk. If you are drunk, you do not admit it... You're basically shooting yourself in the foot by admitting that you have had a few drinks while fiddling around on wikipedia, (and in some cases, 3 cases???) learn from that pal..."	0|0|0|0|0|0

Water in the ColiseumFWIW, I watched a program on the History channel a couple of months ago, the focus of which was a chemical study of the makeup of the plaster used in the Coliseum, and examination of the flooding and drainage facilities the Romans had built into the coliseum.The program concluded that the plaster used contained small, but notable amounts of the substance that the Romans used in aqueducts for waterproofing, but not enough that it was designed to be a permanent feature of the arena. It also concluded that the coliseum could have been flooded overnight, and that it was probably built with it being flooded shortly after completion- but not again after that- in mind.I can’t find (in the brief search I’ve just done) anything I can cite, so I’m not going to put it into the article yet… but I’d say that the section relating to the flooding of the coliseum is probably slightly out of date.	0|0|0|0|0|0

"The previous comment makes several incorrect statements about Baybayin's status as a script, the origin of its name, and what ""Sanskrit"" refers to. Baybayin is a single script, like Latin, Arabic or Devanagari in all their variations are single scripts. It is most definitely not a group or family of scripts; no separate ""Sulat Bisaya"" ever existed, and authentic Kapampangan script was merely the most notable regional variant of Baybayin. There were no special regional variations despite the false impression given by inaccurately wirtten samples of Baybayin from various regions as written by foreigners not used to writing the letters correctly. Scott, Villamor and especially Santamaría have shown clearly that the handwriting of different people in the same region, even from the same document, shows moer differences than the so-called ""regional scripts"" written in distorted handwriting by foreigners. Modern ""Kulitan"" or ""Súlat Kapampangan"" is the recent invention of one person who took a 19th century French visitor's interpretation of Baybayin letters as written in an unknown source or sources from Pampanga, and combined these with a structure derived from a combination of Kawi and Korean Han'gul. It is a modern constructed script with no relation to how it was actually written when it was used as part of daily life. The name Baybayin originated with Tagalog speakers, not the Spanish, who at first just called it ""sus letras"" (their letters). Baybayin comes from a word that originally meant to put things in a sequence or a particular order.  Sanskrit is a language, not a script or group of scripts. All these facts can be checked in the existing literature. Anyone who wants to write an accurate article should consult at the very least Paul Morrow's web site ""Ang Baybayin"", Santamaría's ""El ""Baybayin"" en el archivo de Santo Tomas"", Villamor's ""The Old Philippine Writing/La Antigua Escritura Filipina"", and Marcilla y Martín's ""Estudio de los Antiguos Alfabetos Filipinos"".

" July 2014 (UTC)I didn't say that the summary= attribute is not working; I said that it was marked as obsolete. Obsolete in this instance means that browsers claiming compliance with HTML 5 need not support it, and people writing pages that claim compliance with HTML 5 should not use it. But most browsers that support HTML 5 also support HTML 4, not just because it will take a long time for everybody with a website to rewrite the content for HTML 5 (if it ever happens: there are still a lot of HTML 2.0 or 3.2 compliant pages out there that would fail a conformance check for HTML 4, let alone HTML 5), but also because HTML 5 has not yet reached the W3C Recommendation stage, so the current stable standard is HTML 4.01.On some discussion pages (I know of at least three threads outside of User talk: space) there is a scaremonger going around telling people to stop using the  element ASAP, because it's marked as obsolete in HTML 5.

"Jeztah, the explaination above (that since the article of the 1982 war is called 1982 Lebanon War and since that war only since 2006 has been called the First Lebanon War only in and to Israel, then this war should be called 2006 Lebanon War is incorrect and that logic is not supported by Wikipedia policy. The 2006 Lebanon has very little credentials (as I am proving above.) Israel-Hezbollah War carries no POV implications (the excuse George.Saliba named above is purely original and cannot be heard anywhere else in all seriousness.) Using his logic, 2006 Lebanon war would be incorrect since fighting began and took place in Israel as well. Israel-Hezbollah War meets the criteria of Rule #1 and #2. Neither George.Saliba nor any other editor has come close to proving another single name. And George.Saliba, ""(c) it doesn't list the party that suffered the most death and destruction as a result of the conflict."" Way to make up Wikipedia policy! I do not appreciate that at at all. You know as an editor that that is purely and totally irrelevant.  I agree that ""2006 Lebanon war"" isn't perfect, but it is the closest to meeting Wikipedia policy we have found thus far. Also, the ""(c) it doesn't list the party that suffered the most death and destruction as a result of the conflict."" is entirely relevant to Wikipedia policy, per naming conventions rule #3. It becomes quickly apparent to anyone doing even the minimum amount of research that ""Israel-Hezbollah war"" doesn't meet rules #1 or #2. It might meet rule #3, though that is also disputable. —  [talk] "	0|0|0|0|0|0

Please do not add empty sections to articles as you did to Oberon Zell-Ravenheart. Since several styles of citation are permitted by WP:CITE, and not all of them use a notes section, adding such an empty section is rather presumptive on your part in an article of which you are not one of the regular editors. WP:CITE clearly states that it is the regular editors of the article who get to decide which of several citation methods will be used. Some of these use inline citations without footnotes...

"After this case, the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP) attempted a nationwide assessment of child grooming.  The report found that police, social services and charities were failing to properly investigate this ""hidden issue"" and that a quarter of offenders reported for child grooming since 2008 were Asian, an apparently disproportionate figure, but Peter Davies, the head of Ceop, was quick to clarify that the findings did not provide a national picture because of incomplete data, and cautioned against extrapolating anything from the results. He added that ""looking at this issue through the lens of ethnicity does not do the victims any favours.""Again - I'm not sure that this section needs to exist. Also from the outset it is misleading. CEOP constantly monitor for and act upon child grooming  - they didn't suddenly decide to start after this case. CEOP has existed since April 2006 and there has been a phased introduction of their work in conjuration with partners ever since - starting it's main recognised operations in 2009, by which time the police were acting. The wording implies that CEOP had not acted earlier to protect the victims - they could not act they did not exist! TTFN    "	0|0|0|0|0|0

Dbinder, you asked if someone could verify those possible future regional members... well, if someone really could they wouldn't be possible future members but future members....anyway:as SAS ownes the majority stake in arBaltic and a 49% stake in Estonian Air with whome they have a close coopeartion, so it's very likely that these two airlines will go the way that Blue1 already went and join the alliance as Regional Members.Air One is very close with Lufthansa and fully integrated in Lufthansa's Miles&More; FFP. In fact they are the only fully integrated Airline that is not a Star Alliance member yet. But that seems to be a matter of time.At the very moment Austrian Airlines ownes a 49% Stake in Slovak Airlines. As the Slovak government is planning to sell off the remaining stake in that airline it is highly likely that Austrian will accquire these stakes. A Star Alliance membership is absolutely possible. Silk Air is a fully owned subsidiary of Singapore Airlines. I won't comment on that, as I have never heard of them being a candidate for Alliance membership, but doesn't seem unlikely.Aegean Airlines and Lufthansa started cooperation last year and according to some statements in the German press both airlines seem to be very interessted in Aegean joining the Alliance.Luxair has strong ties to Lufthansa and Austrian... might not be joining in the nearest future, but would definitely be welcome in the AllianceSince you removed Qatar Airways from the list of possible members... It's no secret that Star is really interessterd in Qatar Airways. On the other hand Qatar Airways strengthened their cooperation with Lufthansa, ANA and United last year... they are definitely leaning towards Star Alliance.They are at least as likely to join Star as TAM or SN Brussles etc. to join OneWorld / Malaysia Airlines to join Skyteam	0|0|0|0|0|0

"It was not a personal attack, but rather a racist remark about Indians in general. No, I did not accuse Anir1uph of being unfamiliar with the English language because he is Indian, his nationality was irrelevant. Anir1uph showed failure to use the English language correctly, common practice among non-native English speakers. I am fed up with uneducated third world citizens who edit Wikipedia according to their own POV. Anir1uph is a pretentious editor and forms fart of a larger Indian demographic who subtly edit Wikipedia pushing their own POV, using weasel words and do not adhere to consensus. There is a growing concern among a considerable number of White Western editors that due to the increased availability of computers and the internet around the world - the number of uneducated third world citizens with a POV agenda to their edits is rising rapidly. Nationalism is a large factor in this and it isn't healthy for the Wikipedia community. There is an ongoing clash of culture and outlooks, Asians view the world differently than Europeans and North Americans. In my opinion the sooner editors are restricted to editing Wikipedia in their native tongue the better. I will hold my hands up for my disliking of India and the Indian population, I have a ferocious and bitter attitude towards them, but not hatred.

"If you really beleive all that Shia crap, then good luck to you, cuz you're gonna need it in life.  You don't seem to have a solid grip on reality.  You seem to live in your own world. Anyhow, I will give you a bit of clue free of charge.  The reason there are some favourable Hadiths for Iranians is, surprise surprise, because out of the 6 main Hadith authors, 4 were Iranians, including the 3 most authoritative ones:  Bukhari, Termezi and Hajjaj.  Nasai was also Iranian.  The first 3 were Khurasani, and Nasai was from Pars.  The other 2 Hadith authors are not as major and their works are basically a copy-and-paste from the Hadith of the Iranian authors.  Hajjaj was from Neyshapour but claimed to be of Qushayri origin, so that he was better accepted as some ""real Arab"" from an authentic Arabic origin, but there is academic information that he was indeed of Khorasani origin, and his claim of ""al-Qushayri"" roots is unverifiable.  The most authoritative of the Hadiths is al-Bukhari (from the city of Bukhara).  Having read what you wrote for me, I have reason to believe that someone like you is out of touch with reality and I am not even going to accept an edit war with someone like you. So I let you be happy by deleting the ""forced"" out of the article, and stay happy with your romanticism and keep thinking that Shahrbanoo indeed chose Husayn and they ""lived happily ever after!"", and both Ali and Muhammad knew Persian, and ""Shahrbanoo realized that they had special knowledge""!! hehe no wonder your nation is the way it is today, their ""educated"" people are like you, I can imagine what the uneducated ones are like!!  -)   22:15, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)"	0|0|0|0|0|0

AT-number system There were scholars and there is a classification system for fairy tales > Check out AT-number system at Antti Aarne: the Aarne-Thompson system catalogues some 2500 basic plots from which, for countless generations, European and Near Eastern storytellers have built their tales. As Europeans and Near-Easterners travelled to the New World, the Far East, Africa, and other distant places, their tales migrated as well, often flourishing in their new environments. Hence, the Aarne-Thompson system encompasses tales found around the world. Cinderella is classified as 510A (see Cinderella), so is Rhodopis and Ye Xian. Rhodopis is recognized as older than Ye Xian. hence, Windling's comment is unqualified and misonformed, and should honestly not be included in an encyclopedia at all. That means you should stop editing the article. Regards	0|0|0|0|0|0
Most cover appearances The two individuals who appear on the most Dynamite magazine covers are John Schneider and Michael J. Fox.  Each appears on four separate covers.  John Schneider is known for his role in The Dukes of Hazzard.  Michael J. Fox is known for his roles in Family Ties and the Back to the Future film franchise.  I will incorporate this information into the article at some point.  Thanks.	0|0|0|0|0|0

And precisely for this reason I did not say that in the main article. If you see that conversation, I was justifying why I wrote in the article that ""GNU tmpfile is reentrant"" which is obviously too system-specific. It was precisely because I don't know if other implementations are reentrant, and the only objective thing I can say is that GNU tmpfile is reentrant."	0|0|0|0|0|0

"In point of fact the plot summary unaccountably omits the key revelation that implicates Phelps as the real mole and mastermind behind the murders of Ethan's team, i.e., Ethan's discovery, after his argument with Krieger in the London hotel, that the Bible he has been consulting to communicate with Max was originally from the Drake hotel in Chicago. This points the finger at Phelps' being in the Prague safe house prior to his purportedly first meeting with the team to discuss the mission and where he incidentally mentions his stay at the Drake. The crucial relevance of this is made obvious at the time of its discovery and is later confirmed during the showdown in the baggage department when Phelps asks Ethan when he ""knew,""  and then remarks ""damn Gideons!""

"The net effect is that you deleted a bunch of content, plus which there is more to say about each individual rate (construction particulars for instance), plus it doesn't work with the categorization system. When thinking about merging articles, one important thing to consider is whether the article is small because it's new and needs more content, or it will always be small. In the case of the RN rates, all have much to say about them - rationale, evolution, employment, plus a picture or two so we can see what they looked like. This article should be about the system as a whole (who introduced it and why? When did it go out of use? How did it compare to other nations' systems?) - once you have adequate treatment of all that, plus the two screenfuls with two representative pictures per rate, that's a pretty hefty article, no longer easy for reader to get the basic definition of ""third-rate"". When considering organization like this, it's worthwhile to look at history of all the articles concerned, and maybe query the editors who set it up, because what you've effectively done is to destroy article structure that I and others carefully set up some time ago. Talk pages are mostly used for debate, so lack of talk page bits combined with multiple editors in history indicates that all the editors agreed perfectly, no need to discuss.  08:01, 14 Sep 2004 (UTC)"	0|0|0|0|0|0

"Karamu High SchoolHi Gadfium, thank you for starting the page on Karamu HS but a lot of the informaion is now out of date and the Karamu HS BOT will now administer information for the site.  Thanks  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 222.153.19.90   You are welcome to edit the article, but you cannot control it. Please add only information which can be sourced. You also cannot copy information directly from the internet, unless that information is under a suitable open content licence, usually CC-BY-SA. For the section you have copied from the school website to be acceptable, you will have to place such a licence statement on that page. Otherwise, you are violating the school's copyright. There are alternatives, such as proving that you represent the school and have the right to relicence the material, which would have to go to someone higher in Wikipedia than me. It's much simpler to place a licence notice on the school website. You can also rewrite the material in your own words so no copyright violation occurs.I suggest you always edit using an account, since your IP address may change and that makes it more difficult to establish that the edits are coming from the same person. You should also use an account representing a single person, not the whole BoT. See WP:ORGNAME.Finally, you have a conflict of interest on the article. This doesn't prevent you from making purely factual edits, but you should not attempt to promote the school by, for example, using peacock phrases. It gets tricky if there is material critical of the school - in that case you should add comments on the talk page rather than edit the material directly. I accepted the removal of the section on the ""ERO crisis"", which was unsourced and out of date, although quite interesting. That was not critical of your school, but I think it would have been more appropriate for you to have suggested its removal on the talk page rather than doing so yourself.-gadfium Thanks for the message.  Not sure where we go to from here or what is your motivation for this Wiki.  Are you a past pupil?  The BOT are confused why you are seeking to edit the Wiki when the school and the BOT are the legal owners of the school and its information.  Quite happy to stick within the guidelines of Wikipedia but who is making the judgement calls on what is relevant content eg ""generally regarded by residents as less conservative"" where is the evidence i.e. facts to substantiate this claim?  Who decides Karamu's Alumni?  All information on our website has been written with BOT delegated authority and is the proprty of the BOT so no problems there.  Will follow up on other suggestions regarding edit accounts etc when I have more knowledge as still a first time user and know very little apart from the wiki page for KHS is simply not an accurate information page for KHS in 2010 and the BOT are not happy as democratically elected trustees of the school to have this continue.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 222.153.15.181   I am not a former student at the school. I edit Wikipedia on many subjects, mostly to do with New Zealand. I am concerned that articles be accurate but I also make sure that no copyright is violated when material is added to articles.You are probably correct that the BoT owns the school. It probably also owns the copyright on the school website. It clearly does not own all information about the school, and it does not own any Wikipedia article. We cannot allow anyone on the internet to copy material from the school's website to Wikipedia simply because they claim to represent the BoT, unless we have proof that they actually do so. To put any material on Wikipedia is to licence it under Wikipedia's Terms of Use, which is under a CC-BY-SA licence. I am not allowing the material to be added to Wikipedia verbatim without such proof, because I am protecting the school's copyright. The simplest method of providing proof that the material on the school website can be copied to Wikipedia - and any other publisher which wishes to redistribute Wikipedia's content - is to add a copyright notice to the page in question saying that the contents are released	0|0|0|0|0|0

I would be happy to format all rounds if people like it (i was rather hoping people would help me).

This has been done because the article seems to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable, that is, why an article about that subject should be included in Wikipedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert notability may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, and if you can indicate why the subject of this article is notable, you may contest the tagging. To do this, add  on the top of the page (below the existing db tag) and leave a note on the article's talk page explaining your position. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm its subject's notability under the guidelines.For guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria for biographies, for web sites, for bands, or for companies.

If you obtained it from a website, then a link to the website from which it was taken, together with a restatement of that website's terms of use of its content, is usually sufficient information. However, if the copyright holder is different from the website's publisher, then their copyright should also be acknowledged.As well as adding the source, please add a proper copyright licensing tag if the file doesn't have one already.

People like Merridew and Joe have already decided I'm a ""gravedancer"" and have repeatedly attacked me with that label with no evidence, but weren't blocked for any of it. Merridew was finally blocked for edit warring and I don't even know what Joe was blocked for. Long story short, if people are going to pin labels on me and destroy my attempts at discussion with character assassinations, what's the point? What's the point of caring about Wikipedia when the same characters keep poisoning the well? All it does is make me defensive and want to fight.

"Any reason why? As we dont want vandalism on the Main Page so that is why it's protected. Theres not much to change anyway since its split into articles in a different area.  ۝۝۝҈ ►talk► And the fact that it is automatically updated per transcluded pages and variables ({{Wikipedia:Featured Article/{{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTDAY}}, {{CURRENTYEAR}}).  ~trip Shh! It's obviously a vandal trying to learn how to vandalise the Main Page. Feed them disinformation!  The page is cascadingly (if that's even a word) protected, so if he or she is a vandal, there is no way that he or she could vandalize pages transcluded onto the main page.  ~trip You have to type in the ""super-password"" into the searchbox, which Jimbo Wales gives to his most trusted users. Then, you get a big red button that says ""Are you sure you want to edit the Main Page?"". If you click it, you can edit it (but only you, because it reads the user's IP address). Once you make the edit, it takes effect (but it isn't recorded in history, and can only be seen in a special log, which is only accessable using the ""super-password""). That's why they say things like {{CURRENTMONTH}}, {{CURRENTYEAR}}, etc., to fool new users. MISDISINFORMATION COMPLETE ·  Talk Pedantically, misinformation is different from disinformation...  Fixed; thank you. -) ·  Talk Don't listen to AO. The correct way to edit the main page is simple. To edit the main page you need to follow these steps:Take off all your clothesGet a friend, parent or whatever to take a photo of you editing wikipedia naked. This photo must be at least 1500x1000 pixels. (Editing the page Naked will extend your editing capability by 1 minutes but any other page is fine)Upload said found to the wikimedia commons under a license of you choiceGo to the sandbox and put your photo thereRepeat the above step 12 times when the photo gets changedOnce you've done this, come back and click on view source. You will see a message on your screen for about 1 second. It will give you the name of a page you must edit. If you productively edit this page within 5 seconds you will now be able to edit the main page! If you miss either of this you will have to start all over again from step one (including a new photo)Be aware that if at any time you vandalise wikipedia or try to pass off a photo of someone else as you, you will be banned from editing the main page for life x 100Good luck! Hmm... I know this discussion is cold, but wouldn't it be awesome if the Welcome to Wikipedia box said ""everyone can edit - even this very page!"" or ""Click here to edit this very page?"" This would really reinforce the idea of Wikipedia's editability. Maybe: somehow protect the current content of the page, and add a box containing edits at the bottom? I realise no-one would ever agree to this - the chances of vandalism, profanity etc. being posted there are 100%. But it would be pretty cool, wouldn't it?

"I would be glad to, Noformation. A conflict of interest is defined as ""Where advancing outside interests is more important to an editor than advancing the aims of Wikipedia"". The aims of Wikipedia is to produce a ""neutral, reliably sourced encyclopedia"". My position is that editors from the rational-skeptic wikiproject and their ilk are NOT neutral in this subject, and in fact are incapable of being neutral because they do not have any hands on empirical experience with acupuncture, no specialist dedicated learning in it, have not taken the time to grapple with the unique and complex paradigm that contextualizes it, and thus their knowledge of it is incomplete and immature, and they are ill-equiped to provide a full, rounded, mature and neutral synthesis of the information available on this topic.Now, as for myself, I will tell it straight, I work 12~15 hours per week in acupuncture practice, earning $35 per hour. Acupuncture practice is not my main source of income, in fact my only purpose for practicing acupuncture is to deepen my understanding of the art and sharpen my skills in it. It requires 10,000 hours of purposeful practice to become a master of any discipline, and one day I aim to achieve mastery in this discipline.I refute the suggestion that those people who are most qualified, have the most experience, have done the most study, and are most knowledgeable and passionate about this subject should be excluded from editing on the grounds of COI. In fact these are the ones whose input is most valuable, far more valuable than the input of ivory-tower rational skeptics who only bother to attempt to understand acupuncture through a theoretical, critical and dismissive point of view. In fact, considering the tone of most editors on the acupuncture talk page, which emulates the tone of those ""Quackwatch"" websites that proliferate on the web these days, and considering their devoted following of Edzard Ernst and their elevation of his work as the number 1 source on the page (literally), and their transparent agenda of ""de-bunking"" the ""pseudo-science"" they consider acupuncture to be, it rather seems to an objective observer that is those editors who are "" advancing outside interests"" rather than being neutral, and thus they in breach of COI, as opposed to I.

" Re:CUplex Hello Tungilik!Unfortunately, you cannot, even tough you work and have access information at the City of North Battleford because no original research says ""original research used on Wikipedia to refer to material—such as facts, allegations, and ideas—for which no reliable, published sources exist"" which means if an article has no sources it cannot be notable and hence counted as original research per General notability guideline.Make sure that your sources must be reliable, if you want to know if a source is reliable. WP:SOURCE says ""a source material must have been published, the definition of which for our purposes is made available to the public in some form. Unpublished materials are not considered reliable"" You can use university-level textbooks, books published by respected publishing houses, magazines, journals and mainstream newspapers as reliable sources. Never use blogs as sources as WP:NEWSBLOG says ""Never use blog posts that are left by readers as sources. For personal or group blogs that are not reliable sources.""Wikipedia strongly prefer ""free"" files, wherever possible. When no ""free"" file exist, it sometimes to ask a permission to use a non-free (copyright-protected) file under the ""fair use"" provision. Ideally, most free files should be uploaded to Wikimedia Commons instead of Wikipedia. In uploading images, only logged in users with autoconfirmed accounts are allowed to upload images. Now, you first find out whether the image is legal in the United States (where the Wikipedia servers are located) also, if the image has not been released (to your knowledge) under a license, and is still under copyright you must gain permission to use the image from the copyright holder. Next if you're finish, determine which image copyright tag is applicable for your file.In the procedure of uploading it, You can upload an image by using the Upload file link on the left side of the main page under Toolbox. Use good filenames because some filenames (such as highly generic filenames produced automatically by digital cameras) are disallowed, and attempting to use them will generate an error message.Example of good file names: "":Image:City of London skyline from London City Hall - Oct 2008.jpg"" ""Sir John Betjeman (1906-1984).jpg""Example of bad file names: ""Image01.png"" ""DSC00001.JPG""I hope this helps in improving your article, I know it is a little bit complicated but you can ask questions at the Teahouse with more experienced editors in the wiki.

"Hi, you can unblock my page now.  Before you level charges of ""harassment"" or ""personal attacks,""  in the future perhaps, in your infinite wisdom and expertise, you may wish to delve into the comments and behavior of the one leveling the accusation.  For instance, summarily deleting posts in a section that editor had never shown interest in prior, making childish remarks in comments to said deletions indicating the editor's lack of maturity, accusing this editor of generating the very information he cited, etc.  I find it interesting that I am considered a ""sockpuppet"" for supposedly having a ""political agenda"" and working for someone else, but when I accuse the two of you of colluding that is considered ""harassment.""  At least you are smart enough not to have a ""banner"" saying you prefer the metric system.  How is openly expressing political views ON WIKIPEDIA acceptable, yet inferring that I have some sort of agenda because my views don't jive with yours is grounds for being blocked?

I'm starting to hate Heather Tom but I still love Katie P I love Don Diamont too just hated him on Y&R.; Highly doubt he got better from when I watched in the 80s. Maura was Diane Jenkins? Really? I remember her from Y&R; back in the early 80s. She was some slut who was portrayed by some Donnelley girl. I totally can't picture Maura as Diane. Eeew! Anyway if you're fearing the future for GH then I won't start watching again. I wanted to get back into it this year but if it's still crummy storylines then screw it lol. BTW is Leslie Charleston still on GH?? Didn't she portray like someone named Monica or something?? Yeah I hate The Talk. It was such a poor replacement for ATWT, if they wanted to cancel it then the actors can just come to my house and perform the soap for me on the spot!!! lol.

An example: The 18th Dynasty ended when its last three kings—Tutankhamun, Aye, and Horemheb—each died without an heir.Think about this sentence.  First the rest of the article does not give dynasty by dynasty chronology.  Second, we are not told about the start of the 18th Dynasty or of it being anything special.  Third, how does a dynasty end when three subsequen rulers die withouth heirs?  I mean they ruled AFTER each other.

"does anyone know wth this means""In the original script, Marty's playing rock and roll at the dance caused a riot which had to be broken up by police. This, combined with Marty accidentally tipping Doc off to the ""secret ingredient"" that made the time machine work (Coca-Cola) caused history to change. When Marty got back to the 1980s, he found that it was now the 1950s conception of that decade, with air-cars and what-not (all invented by Doc Brown and running on Coca-Cola). Marty also discovers that rock and roll was never invented, and he dedicates himself to starting the delayed cultural revolution. Meanwhile, his dad digs out the newspaper from the day after the dance and sees his son in the picture of the riot.

moved discussion on origin The following was inserted into the article by user:144.132.100.183I do not dispute that Jack Dyer is credited with inventing the drop punt. Hugh Hinks invented the Drop Punt in 1907. Page 342 & 347 ì In The Beginning There Was Carisbrookî by Daryl McLeish, 2001. TABTABDespite claims to the contrary Carlton believed  that Horrie Clover invented the drop punt. Teammate Newton Chandler believed that Clover first saw the kick used by a teammate at Carisbrook and that he perfected it from there. 6th Edition The Encyclopedia of AFL Footballers. TABTABLen Metherell, who made his debut in 1930, see 6th Edition The Encyclopedia of AFL Footballers, certainly used the drop punt, and indicated that he had learned it from his father. With the retirement of Dyer in 1949 the drop punt gradually fell into disuse. When Bartle, of Geelong, took a spectacular mark five meters from goal in 1958 and kicked a behind, the Geelong advertiser admonishes: he foolishly tried a drop punt. 3AW Book of Footy Records 1989 page195/6  TABTABInterestingly Jack Dyer commenced with Richmond in 1931 and would have played against Clover and Metherell.  TABTABNext recorded  use was by the Collier Brothers see Page 195 3AW Book of Footy Records.  TABTABNext recorded use was by Jack Dyer. The Sporting Globe FOOTBALL Book 1948. TABTABPage 49: Jack Dyer gets goals with the sillies looking kick in football history. TABTABJack Dyer adapted the Collier Brothers of Collingwood’s Drop Punt, which they used as a short pass of around ten yards in place of a hand pass. They only used it to pass the ball to each other over the head of an opponent. See page 165, Jack Dyer Captain Blood as told to Brian Hanson, Paul, (London), 1965.  TABTABInteresting note.  TABTABThe drop punt had a slow take-up by teams: Dyer himself attributed this to  TABTABCoaches do no teach this kick to their players for one reason. They cannot do it and have never bothered to learn its fundamentals Football Clinic, p.167 Captain Blood, Jack Dyer. As told to Brian Hansen, Paul, (London), 1965. TABI cannot find any information that records that Jack Dyer actually was the first. I have reworded the article slightly to reflect this, but when you are talking about things that happened 70-100 years ago, we'll never get a definitive answer, so have to just go by the reliable sources, even if they contradict each other to a degree.	0|0|0|0|0|0

" Richard Stallman said on October 01 2008, that Moonlight is Free Software in an interview where he was asked a leading question meant to bash Moonlight by someone who is widely known to criticize Moonlight and everything else Novell does: ""Q: Microsoft encourages developers to build Web sites that incorporate Silverlight. For GNU/Linux to be able view Silverlight objects, Moonlight, which is built on top of Mono, needs to be downloaded from Novell’s Web site. Would you advise GNU/Linux users to install Moonlight and accept such changes in the World Wide Web?"" ""RMS: Moonlight is free software, so I don’t see anything bad about installing Moonlight as such. It seems that the reason it needs to be downloaded from Novell’s web site is that it isn’t ready to be included in any GNU/Linux distros."" Seems to me that unless you think you know better than Richard Stallman, Moonlight [i]is[/i] Free Software. Period. End of discussion."	0|0|0|0|0|0

If I may clarify, my question was not regarding the reliability of the OGTT for reactive hypoglycemia. The difficulty with this section is the analogy between OGTT and the Rorschach. Your analogy works for the person well-read in psychology who shares your opinion of the Rorschach, but falters for the general reader. The Rorschach inkblot test article says that the test is the second most used test for forensic assessment; if this statement is correct, then I wonder about the utility of your analogy, at least for those who do not already share your point of view...

As for my commenting on Daniella, you or any other editor elsewhere, sorry, unless and until there was a rule against it, I'll follow the dictates of my own conscious on this one.  I personally think that what you guys do is far more insulting than anything I've said as I say that you insult my memory, my life experience, my intelligence and my common sense.  And I DO doubt Daniella's sincerity in that I don't really believe that she's a student working on a research paper on ex-premies.  So there you go.  BTW, when you say that she maybe got the ""slap in the face"" wrong, don't you think that she substantially misrepresented what I said?  Surely a slap in the face and the academic equivalent of same are two entirely different things.  One is a physical assault and highly illegal.  The other is not.  Do you agree?  Why, then, do you think she'd have misrepresented my words so and don't you think it rather rich that she herself is complaining about things being taken out of context? "	0|0|0|0|0|0

Hello Gerardw. If you click on Forsena's contribution list, and review the edit summaries, it is hard to believe that he's patiently seeking consensus on Kosovo matters. (For instance, Removing data from albanian extermist vandal member Angelo De La Paz). In particular, look at this edit of Battle of Kosovo where Forsena goes against all the cited references, and actually *removes* most of them. On the matter of 'disputed country' versus 'disputed region', if Angelo continues to make that change without getting consensus first, it would be worrisome. Though your point about the Balkan topic ban is noted, since Forsena has not edited any articles since it was announced, it is too soon to give him credit for following it. The announcement that he was under Digwuren restrictions on 7 January seems to have had no effect at all on his edits. I will leave Angelo a note that his editing was discussed here.	0|0|0|0|0|0

" Cleanup urgently needed Urgent request for Wikipedia admin to cleanup this article - either stick to the facts or delete article. The Ronald Ryan article is full of alleged unproven hearsay ...

Fact is that what Ryan is alleged to have said to whom has never been proven, confirmed nor recorded - there is no evidence anywhere!   The facts are that there was a total lack of scientific ballistic forensic evidence to prove Ryan guilty. the factual serious ambiguities in the case, the factual dire inconsistencies of all eyewitnesses' evidence, the missing pieces of vital evidence that also could not be scientifically tested, the fact that only Paterson's one single fired shot was heard by all persons. and the most unusual pleas by jury members not to execute Ryan (maybe they had second thoughts about Ryan's guilt). Finally, the fact that the public heard Brosnan's comments on ABC Australia National Radio in 2007 ...  I don't know who's shot killed who! ... which should have put an end to all the unproven allegations still being made about Ryan confessing guilt.

"Show 'n' TellA question for   It may seem an odd question to WP purists, but considering the importance WP places on reliability of secondary sources, why does WP not require a same or similar vetting process of its editors, particularly those who seem to speak only for themselves?  The entire concept of requiring contributors to discuss/argue with a username is absurd in its most basic interpretation.  For all I know, I could be spinning my wheels fighting for accuracy with a demented, mind game-playing geek living in inner Mongolia.  It is imperative, in my mind, that those who demand respect offer up some sort of evidence, as I have, of their actual ability, credibility, reliability, accountability...  their authority to control.  If it's required of the sources, it should certainly be required of those who quote them and write about them.  Similarly, how do I ""call for consensus?""  Who may be a member and how is each identified?  Thanks in advance...    : That's the beauty of Wikipedia. Anyone can edit it. That's the point. You have no more authority than any other editor here, regardless of your credentials. Also, anyone can participate when trying to achieve consensus.

Hi Eric, no. You are not in any way one of the people I was talking about. You just got caught in the crossfire, and if I made you think I was thinking of you I apologise. Your work is consistent good plus even more importantly, you have a sensitivity to other people's work with a few people don't. You build on their work to produce something that improves in quality. The people I was talking about arrive at an article, chop it around, change meanings, change context, spelling, capitalisation and then move on, more often than not without giving the slightest suggestion that they actually knew what they were doing. For example, one guy when he comes across the word taoisigh which is the gaelic plural for taoiseach and which is explained as such on its first mention in some articles, frequently changes it to taoiseachs, a non-existent word. He has tried to change governors-general to governor-generals, Prime Minister to Prime minister. He changed links from President of Ireland to President of Ireland, links to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (ie the form of UK between 1901 and 1922) to United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, so linking the reference to the wrong UK. He mucked up some links to Tánaiste (deputy Irish prime minister) by lower-casing it, changed a series of mentions of First Lady when referring to a specific first lady to lowercase first lady, changed one mention of Garret FitzGerald to Garrett Fitzgerald, removed the word Óg from Gearóid Og Fitzgerald and Mór from Gearóid Mór Fitzgerald, not grasping that they actually were two different people (Mór = big in gaelic and indicated the father, Óg meaning small meant his son) and ended up turning an article that mentioned them both into gobbledigook. That is just some of my work he has mucked up. He made a complete mess of some biology articles, reduced an article on mediæval history to such a degree of unreadability that the author, one of the world's top mediæval historians, quick wiki in disgust. I know at least six people who have left wiki over his actions. And there are quite a few such people. Not a lot, but enough to mangle everything they touch. Another contributor constantly changed an elementary fact in 18th century history on the basis of google searches. I checked on google. The majority of articles said he was right. Those google searches turned up stuff that were barely of high school standard. But she treated google as sacrosanct. If a google search said it, it was gospel. I have had political science articles which I have written and which were based on hard fact, in mediocre garbage, applying wrong capitalisation (again based on google searches that largely threw up high school essays), wrong spelling, wrong interpretation, etc. I wasn't reacting simply to the Droop Quota at all (that was the sixth article that day I had done that had been 'hit'. In that case Michael Hardy as he is prone to do, swept in to a topic he knows little about, changed capitalisation, text and even the formula which is the standard DQ formula taught (in that form because as already happened in the discussion on the talk page, if you leave out the parentheses people muck up the order of the calculation and so get the wrong formula). That intervention was classic Michael; go onto a page about a topic he doesn't know much about and instead of asking why it is written like that, unilaterally change it, in most cases producing a version that is so wrong it would be savaged if any student repeated it in a class.American english and British English use different approaches to capitalisation. Many of the references were to things only found outside the US and so capitalised. Instead he insisted on applying US capitalisation rules to things whose capitalisation is a result of their existence and usage in parts of the world outside the US. That indeed is one of the reasons why google should never be used in checking capitalisation. Apart from its general unreliability, most website mentions in the US are created by people who automatically and incorrectly apply US capitalisation to things that don't exist in the US and are capitalised internationally. A classic example is the electoral system PR.STV (Proportional Representation using the Single Transferable Vote). Michael insisted on lowercasing it on the basis on a google search. PR.STV isn't used in the US and is generally capitalised when referring to the specific voting system, and lowercased when used generically. Where it is mentioned on google, it is largely on the basis of Americans writing about it and downcasing it to suit American english. So Michael unilaterally mucked up the capitalisation, then another US user moved the page to another name that refers to a somewhat similar but not the same electoral system more widely known in the US. So any non-American user would get r	0|0|0|0|0|0
Wikipedia is not for writing about yourself Hi. Welcome to Wikipedia, but it is not a social-networking site like Myspace or Facebook for people to write about themselves or make contacts.

"CategoryLook, no one doubts Wintersun cobines elements of many genres.  To correctly define it you could just say ""melodic metal,"" but there is no doubt it is also melodic death and melodic black (it has many elements of black metal).  I mean Jari was in Arthemesia.  Altogether, Wintersun is very progressive and has elements from power, thrash, black, folk, viking and death.  I think that the genre calssification is fine right now, but it should state something about black metal as I feel that IS a part of Wintersun. "	0|0|0|0|0|0

Thank You Not sure how else to contact you. Hope you don't mind me posting here. Thank you for reviewing my unblock request. I appreciate your taking the time to examine the issue in order to make what I (needless to say) think was a fair judgment.As I already expressed on the Talk page prior to the 7 day block, it's proven futile for me to try to maintain the agreed version (pending revision through further discussion and consensus), as my efforts to undo the reverts of people who refuse to make any kind of effort to discuss their objections on Talk continually (well, twice, prior to this 7 day thing, which doesn't count on this point) result in me getting blocked. Thus, as I said on Talk, I'm going to stick with helping Ling.Nut get his rewrite ready. I hope admins will continue to monitor the Six Day War article and protect it so that versions which have had gone through extensive discussion and consensus-forming processes are not simply reverted by these guys who refuse to discuss their objections/suggestions, etc. If you can do anything to help out the majority of editors who are reasonably working together to improve the article in this regard, I would appreciate it. And it's probably fair for me to speak for that majority in that regard. I trust my decision to let other editors whom I discuss the wording with actually implement the agreed version(s) will demonstrate my good faith to admins responsible for twice blocking me. I just want to see this article improved, including by keeping it in compliance with WP:NPOV. Thanks again. Cheers.	0|0|0|0|0|0
I keep wondering why you coming here arguing with me, when you make no sense at all? Don't you realize that many people might be coming to see this discussion here? You are basically telling everyone here not to trust the CIA, BBC, United Nations' 2006 chart that is posted above, which is also posted at BBC, and that everyone should trust your 1980 map which was made by an unknown person. First of all, I am not arguing over the number of each ethnic group but instead you are. I never changed the numbers, rather I changed and replaced the old 1980, hard to read and understand map of yours. My map, the one above, explains little more about each Ethnic group, while yours does not. Demographics of Afghanistan should not just be the numbers of each group but also include a brief explanation about who or what these people are and or where they originate from. By watching your actions and you keep insisting that your map remains in Afghanistan's article, there must be something you are up to. Also something I noticed, you keep talking about the numbers of Pashtuns should be lower, which indicates that you wish to see them die or something. I will slowly look around for an administrator to help with removing and deleting your silly outdated man soon. I wish not to bother talking or discussing anything with you as I find that you are not a nice person to talk or socialize with. You keep reminding that Pashtuns killed this Pashtuns killed that, why don't you discuss about Pashtuns always being killed by invaders. They have the right to rule their country and they have the right to kill anyone they find as a traitor to their country. This law is practiced in all the countries of the world. By now I've already realized that you are not just a traitor to Afghanistan but also a true enemy of Pashtuns. I have Allah (Almighty God) on my side and that's why I always win.	0|0|0|0|0|0

However, my use of some anything-other-than-the-common-as-muck spellings can, has, does, and most likely will, cause conflicts at times. My use of them is well meant.

That actually sounds quite reasonable. Keep in mind that I've been blocked largely to prevent me from participating in discussions that were already underway off-Wikipedia before I was blocked.It's refreshing to see some true civility for a change.  Especially after having had four different admins block me (actually, it's probably more than the last four), without one word of discussion with me from any of them before doing so.  Then there's the whole thing about much of the discussion not being aboveboard, but rather taking place in the modern version of the proverbial smoke-filled back room.Duk and Haukur were decent, and know more about what they're talking about because we've been involved in the same discussions at various times in the past; even I've locked horns with both of them at various times, we've managed to come out of it without permanent hard feelings (can't say that for everyone else involved).Mostly, however, what I've much of anything not even remotely resembling civility, in this entire process.  At least not anything close to civility in anything other than a highly ritualized, magic-incantation, Wikipedia-jargon meaning of that term.  It's no wonder that so many of them never use that word without linking it; it has nothing whatsoever to do with real-world concepts of civility as they use it.Your proposal was so much in a different vein that it catches me by surprise.

" More on Wiki writers http://rexcurry.net/wikipedia-lies.html Many errors have been corrected in Wikipedia's Roman salute article.http://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html  The article had many visits from Dr. Curry in the past - see its talk page- as Dr. Curry attempted to correct the many errors.http://rexcurry.net/wikipedia-lies.htmlHowever, the wikipedia article on the ""Roman Salute"" is becoming more dishonest by the week. An earlier version referenced the work of Professor Rex Curry and started thusly: ""The Roman salute is a gesture in which the arm is held out forward straight, with palms down. Sometimes the arm is raised upward at an angle, sometimes it is held out parallel to the ground. The salute was supposed to have been used in the Roman republic, but there is no clear evidence of this. Indeed it is not known whether salutes in the military sense existed at all in Roman culture"" (by Paul Barlow).  A more recent version of the same article is written as if a neo-Nazi has been covering-up again.A big initial problem is that no wiki writer will even attempt to discover the first use of the phrase ""Roman salute"" and thus the writers remain stuck in intellectually dishonest confusion about dates and origins.The article reverts back to its earlier opening concessions to the work of Dr. Curry, conceding that there is no clear evidence of the salute in the Roman Republic and also conceding that there is no evidence of salutes in the military sense at all in Roman culture.The wiki writer then engages in speculation that people today misunderstood some images from ancient Rome.  There is no support for the idea that the ""Roman Salute"" concept arose long ago from misinterpretations of Roman images.  There is as much evidence that, after Dr. Curry's shocking discoveries about the salute's origin with the Pledge of Allegiance, modern writers (including wiki writers) deliberately looked for other explanations and then those writers misinterpreted Roman images in order to cover-up and suppress Professor Curry's discoveries.  The wiki writer then engages in speculation that neoclassical artists misunderstood some images from ancient Rome.  There is no support for the idea that the ""Roman Salute"" concept arose among neoclassical artists from misinterpretations of Roman images.  There is as much evidence that, after Dr. Curry's shocking discoveries about the salute's origin with the Pledge of Allegiance, modern writers (including wiki writers) deliberately looked for other explanations and then those writers seized upon neoclassical artists in order to cover-up and suppress Professor Curry's discoveries.  For example, there is no evidence that Jacques-Louis David actually thought that his painting ""The Oath of the Horatii"" represented an actual historical Roman salute.  All of the evidence indicates that David created the scene out of whole cloth for drama. All of the speculating otherwise is actually the machinations of wiki writers and people of their ilk. The intellectual dishonesty is all the more evident in that the wiki writers deliberately faill to address those very points already made by Dr. Curry http://rexcurry.net/pledgehoratii.html  Further, the Horatii painting depicts three people reaching for weapons.The Tennis Court Oath was painted by David later, and repeats David's use of the dramatic gesture that David concocted, but in a more modern setting.  There is no evidence that it accurately depicts the event protrayed. David was not there. Further, the oath was was written on paper (the paper being read by the central figure?) and the ""oath was taken"" by signing the document. There is no evidence that anyone is taking an oath in the painting (the central figure might be swearing, or he might be reading his document) while those people about him waive hats, talk, holler, point, etc.  Three figures on the left seem to be an inside reference to the Horatii painting.  The wiki writer is misrepresenting the works or reading into them.The distribution of the Eagle Standards was painted by David even later, and repeats David's use of the dramatic gesture that David concocted, but in another modern setting.  There is no evidence that it accurately depicts the event protrayed and there is no evidence that anyone is taking an oath in the painting at all.  The wiki writer claims that this is the mos important of these paintings.  That painting shows no use of the salute in pledging or oath-taking or at all and simply shows various people, with various gestures, acclaiming the central figure and grabbing for, and shouting for, the ""Eagle Standards.""  The wiki writer is misrepresenting the works and reading into them.The wiki writer then claims that other painters during the nineteenth century regularly depicted the straight-arm g	0|0|0|0|0|0

" Four years after writing ""my vision is that Wikipedia should not say E is a fool when all it can really say is that D has called E a fool"" Lima has taken the opposite opinion in the same article.  The preferred edit is that church teaching places the origin of the Eucharist in last supper, and cites the Catholic catechism, and Orthodox Encyclopedia and an Anglican Bishop.  Reading the footnotes, one discovers the cited passages to not support that thesis.  And instead of reproducing quotes faithfully, or arguing for some exception to a policy which requires verifiability, the article is rerverted to the point of view of the editors,  without even selective quotation.On the positive side, I'm learning a lot about Eucharist-not from this Wikipedia article, I have to say, as much as running down footnotes,I never knew the Eucharist was announced before the Last Supper until I read in the Catholic catechism.

Hello, From Nabbobhai - About Cialis (Cialis Drug History) I'm new to Wikipedia, and I recently added a paragraph to wikipedia about Cialis.  I just checked the wikipedia and saw that the contribution I made to the wikipedia requires citation.  I'm not sure how to site my contribution properly because I tried a numerous times to add the link to the source, but someone always removes it, probably you.  So, could you please help me in properly citing the paragraph, or maybe you could add the source for me.  I acquired the information from the following website, (www.buydrugs247.com).  Thank you for your help.  Oh yeah, my name is Nabeel Rahman, and I'm looking forward to learn how to properly use wikipedia.Err.. you can find a better source then buydrugs247.com. That site exists to sell something. Try to find an academic source to add. Try using a search engine, you can and should find better and more reliable sources —— Eagle (ask me for help)	0|0|0|0|0|0
"=Recent deletionsI have removed various references to songs that contain the progression for only very short, irrelevant sections of the songs. Why? So glad to answer. The ""source"" given is Music Notes' sheet music, which is a website that produces and sells arrangements of songs and nowhere states to be a faithful record of the song as written. The Music Notes snippet shown is not enough to show that the song generally uses (or does not use) this four-chord convention. The Music Notes are basically just appended on with no proof whatsoever that they show that the song uses the four-chord progression. I could find the sheet music for any musical work you can think ofsay, Beethoven's Ninthand just tack on the Music Notes. Nobody's going to pay five bucks to read it (myself included) to verify. Those very same Music Notes do not even uphold the article's assertion in cases like Don't Stop Believing. See measure 7? That's a G#m chorda iii chord, which is not in the pop-punk progression. (G# in the bass, with G#, B and D# in the treble. Straight up G#m chord. Definitely a iii.)I'll be restoring the removals presently, I guess. Slash "	0|0|0|0|0|0

"Some of these things I have already changed or deleted. A province really does not have a monetary policy (though it can do some things e. g. about the availability of cash) and the phrase was too general to begin with, so that's gone. I changed ""did nothing to stop"" to ""did not work to stop"", though your criticism is valid. Note however that, when De la Rúa took office, Argentina was already in recession or on the brink of it, and the government concentrated on contractive measures from the start. Then came the corralito, etc. On the whole, the measures were intended to stop the collapse of the economy and all the economic analysts and the IMF were recommending them. I don't remember any major economist recommending an alternative course of action. Note also that ""economic collapse"" doesn't refer only to the critical period November 2001 - February 2002, but to the whole recessive period (1999-2002) and some time before and after. We should agree on a phrase that links De la Rúa's measures with the crisis without falling into any of:""... did not work to stop the economic collapse.""""... ended up precipitating the economic collapse.""""... ultimately caused the economic collapse.""""... were intended to cause the economic collapse."" (!!)""... had nothing to do with the economic collapse"" (!!!)Then the ""import-dependent"" thing. Consider this: right after the devaluation, neighboring countries had to help us get medicine. The public hospital where I worked initially could not get X-ray film from the providers, and then only by paying in cash (and in dollars). Argentina then and still now is incapable of sustaining economic growth without importing certain forms of technology. I'd say that's rather import-dependent, though we may be speaking of different things. What do you propose?What's the problem with the religious aspects of the Supreme Justices? The previous justices were all old, male, and ideologically conservative, and in addition some had ties to the right wing of the Catholic Church. And now two of them are women, one is the president of the Court and the other is a militant atheist in her own words. The clarification is intended to show the reader that the changes introduced in the Supreme Court were really important. Argibay's atheism in particular was even reported as a salient fact in international media. In a country where the Church attacks anyone who dares speak of women's rights, having these two women at the top of one of the country's government branches is extremely significant.The qualification ""historical"" for the payment to the IMF is that (correct me if I'm wrong) Argentina had never decided to pay so much to the IMF or anyone else, not only at the same time but also ahead of schedule; and this payment has re-defined the relationship of Argentina with the IMF and swept with many assumptions about the economic future of the country that were valid before the payment.I'm glad we're discussing this here civilly. Understand that no-one here is (that I know) affiliated with a party or a person (if someone is, it doesn't show), and that we don't have an ideological police, or a bureaucracy that you have to go through before correcting what you believe is wrong in an article; but when an article is not very new and deals with an important topic, you have to consider that most of the content is ""settled"" already and should be treated carefully, to avoid being (or being seen as) disruptive. It's perfectly OK for us to discuss over the tiniest details here.Please sign after your comments and replies (here) using four tildes (~~~~).

Shorter Oxford English DictionaryArrived today, worth every penny. I'm reading some pretty academic texts right now, and words like desinence and meronym are there. Troponymy, regrettably, was not, but all to gather a rating of 10. And, they use the IPA, they give the etymologies and a hundred other things to make it your last stop. We shall forgive them a bit of hyperbole, when they say on the cover that the OED is the greates dictionary in any language. In the fields of dictionaries (of any kind) and scientific publications of any kind, every language faces some stiff German competition. -) The Oxford Style Manual was bought because it was affordable, but as I partly write for a living, I may very well have to concoct something in English, so I think it was not a bad choice. Get them if you can. Cheers  PS: No, we don't have an Icelandic Amazon. Everything I've bought through Amazon has been from the USA, the UK or Germany.	0|0|0|0|0|0
"Thom Hartmann states that in Germany, ""... people fill in hand-marked ballots, which are hand-counted by civil servants, watched over by volunteer representatives of the political parties. ... It's totally clean, and easily audited. And even though it takes a week or more to count the vote ... the German people know the election results the night the polls close because the news media’s exit polls, for two generations, have never been more than a tenth of a percent off.""Unfortunately he's wrong. Generally all votes are counted (twice) by midnight. Then the preliminary final results are announced and the candidates who won are contacted so they can state whether they accept their seats or not. They have a week to reply and then the final results are announced; it's got nothing to do with counting votes for a week (btw. the final result of the election as a whole can take even more time because somtimes some precincts vote later than the other. This year a candidate died in Dresden after the ballots had been finalised and therefore the precinct voted two weeks(?) later"	0|0|0|0|0|0

"My two centsFirst of all, let me just say that I'm very happy Xandar is no longer blocked and I look forward to working together on improving the article in the next few days. This place just isn't the same without Xandar. On the substance of the criticism, I agree on some points, but disagree on the fundamentals. In particular, I'm rather shocked that Xandar suggests we should remove History, which is the most important section of the article. It's almost impossible to rationally justify such a reckless suggestion. The proposal to restore the old version is also very puzzling in light of the fact that it was a hopeless quagmire, as people repeatedly documented. I categorically reject these proposals by Xandar, but I'm willing to work on including some more material through summary style, which would mean greater coverage of topics that Xandar wants mentioned in the article while also keeping down the length.

So if sources are old it does not mean that those are not authentic If so, then people should stop reading shakespear, Albert Einstein's work or even the holy books of all the religions. So donot hide the fact. Moreover you did not address the issue of messing up the part of article ""Mali identifying themselves as Sainis"". I had given you the date when you changed it and I would like to know based upon what source that says that ""Some people in that area identified themselves as Saini apparently due to their intermarriage with Malis"". So stop playing your dirty game. So explain it to me why did you change that part, may be to create more confusion. So matter of the fact is sainis are yduvanshis Shoorsaini lineage and have no relation with Malis who had adopted the name later on."	0|0|0|0|0|0

I pretty much agree. In fact I was just linking Kode9 because I saw the ref when reading the entry page and I know he has a page. Kode9 and Dubstep are certainly both notable, and the inspiration of Ballard is quite interesting, but is probably a good subject for a magazine article, not a Wikipedia one. Certainly, more POV than it should be. I think many good articles are spoiled by vainglorious mentions of friends' bands, so I can see where you are coming from. Wouldn't this suggest removing the whole para, though? If we are going to have the para referring to Kode9, surely it is right to link to his page?	0|0|0|0|0|0

"This is becoming very tiresome.  After the last reasonable attempt at compromise to keep one person (Rothbard) happy as well as everyone else by making the language neutral, Rothbard returned to remove an important qualifying word (""some"") and to change ""parliament"" to ""government"" and to delete documenting links.  That shows lack of good faith and also lack of understanding of parliamentary government.  Regarding the first point, to criticize a mullah or a priest is not to criticize Islam or Christianity, and to criticize one activist in a movement is not to criticize ""the antiwar movement.""  That is simple dishonesty to claim otherwise.  Regarding the second point, in a parliamentary system, the word ""government"" refers to prime minister and cabinet, not to members of parliament.  To advise ""government"" you are advising the prime minister.  Nothing states that Palmer ever met the prime minister, but he spoke to members of the parliament.  Rothbard is perhaps no political scientist, but there is a major difference between them.  Even under the American system, if someone speaks to members of the Congress, it would be dishonest to write that she or he had come to Washington to ""advise the government.""  We had reached a compromise and Rothbard indicated that he could live with it, but he has now gone in without any reason and changed the entry to be misleading.  The agenda at work seems more to defame a person than to provide neutrally articulated information. The issue is raised and it's time for Rothbard to simply back off.  Others here will have to revert his attempt to introduce errors into this entry.   "	0|0|0|0|0|0
The poobotsdam declaration We-the undersigned, representing the hundreds of millions of other vandals and trolls, have conferred and agree that Wikipedia shall be given an opportunity to end this war.The prodigious land, sea and air forces of the undersigned, many times reinforced by their armies and air fleets from the west, are poised to strike the final blows upon Wikipedia. This military power is sustained and inspired by the determination of all the Allied Vandals to prosecute the war against Wikipedia until she ceases to resist.The result of the futile and senseless Chanting Fox resistance to the might of the aroused free peoples of the world stands forth in awful clarity as an example to the people of Wikipedia. The might that now converges on Japan is immeasurably greater than that which, when applied to the resisting Nazis, necessarily laid waste to the lands, the industry and the method of life of Chanting Fox and Lucky 6.9. The full application of our military power, backed by our resolve, will mean the inevitable and complete destruction of Wikipedia and just as inevitably the utter devastation of the Wiki Foundation.The time has come for Wikipedia to decide whether she will continue to be controlled by those self-willed militaristic advisers (e.g. JpGordon, Durvova, J.Delanoy, jdforrester, Sandstein, OrgangeMike, BigDunc, Alison, RodhullandEmu) whose unintelligent calculations have brought the Wikipedia Foundation to the threshold of annihilation, or whether she will follow the path of reason.Following are our terms. We will not deviate from them. There are no alternatives. We shall brook no delay.There must be eliminated for all time the authority and influence of those who have deceived and misled the editors of Wikipedia into embarking on world conquest, for we insist that a new order of peace, security and justice will be impossible until irresponsible militarism is driven from the world.Until such a new order is established and until there is convincing proof that Wikipedia’s war-making power is destroyed, pages in article space to be designated by the Allies shall be occupied to secure the achievement of the basic objectives we are here setting forth.Wikipedia sovereignty shall be limited to the articles of Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, Shikoku and such minor islands as we determine.The Wikipedia military forces, after being completely disarmed, shall be permitted to return to their homes with the opportunity to lead peaceful and productive lives.We do not intend that the admins shall be enslaved as a race or destroyed as a nation, but stern justice shall be meted out to all war criminals, including those who have visited cruelties upon us through abuse of their blocking, checkusering, and protection tools. The Wikipedia Foundation shall remove all obstacles to the revival and strengthening of democratic tendencies amongst Wikipedians. Freedom of speech, of religion, and of thought, as well as respect for the fundamental human rights shall be abolished in favour of whatever is lulziest.Wikipedia shall be permitted to maintain such industries as will sustain her economy and permit the exaction of just reparations in kind, but not those which would enable her to re-arm for war. To this end, access to, as distinguished from control of, raw materials shall be permitted. Eventual Wikipedian participation in world trade relations shall be permitted.The occupying forces of the Vandals shall be withdrawn from Wikipedia as soon as these objectives have been accomplished and there has been established in accordance with the freely expressed will of the Vandals a lulzily inclined and irresponsible government.We call upon Jimbo Wales to proclaim now the unconditional surrender of all Wikipedian armed forces, and to provide proper and adequate assurances of their good faith in such action. The alternative for Wikipedia is prompt and utter destruction.86.176.110.39	0|0|0|0|0|0

" Narciso Yepes's Revolutionary Technical Developments This is a story that has been recounted numerous times by Yepes and by his students: ""You know, the guitar is a very unusual instrument, for it seems that in every city of the world there is a great genius of the guitar, someone who knows every single thing there is to know about the guitar, someone who's genius is so great that he or she can learn nothing from anyone else. However, I have never felt that way about myself. When I was around 15, I could play virtually everything written for the guitar, but I knew I needed a teacher, so I went to see a composer and music teacher by the name of Vicente Ascencio, a very famous man in Spain. The first thing he asked me to play was a ""musical scale."" I played a standard guitar scale using alternating ""i"" and ""m"" fingers, and I played it about as well as any guitarist I had ever heard. Ascencio told me that my scale was not acceptable. He played a scale on the piano, which was much faster than any guitarist could play a scale. Then, he picked up a violin, and played a scale much faster than I could play. He showed me a ""musical scale"" on several other orchestral instruments, and told me that this is how he expected me to play a scale if I was to be a musician. I tried again to match his accepted norm for scales, but I could not do so. I then told him that this could not be done on the guitar, and, in fact, no one at the time could play guitar scales at the tempos Ascensio and others were using on standard classical instruments. He told me, ""Too bad, but if you want to study music with me, you must give up the guitar. I expect you to be able to execute scales at the tempos that have long been the norm."" Well, I had two choices. One was to be the ""genuis of the guitar,"" to get mad and storm out the door. The other choice was to swallow my pride and to accept Ascencio as my teacher, where I would be obligated to perform at the level of his other students. Fortunately, I chose to stay and learn, for ""the door was open"" for Ascencio to be my teacher, and I chose to swallow my pride and study with him, and THIS DECISION HAS MADE ALL THE DIFFERENCE. I went home, thought about scales, and realized that no pianist could play such rapid scales when using only two fingers on the right hand. I started using three fingers instead (ami, mia, iam), and the next week, I was able to play a ""musical scale."" He smiled, and told me that I did not have to give up the guitar after all. Then, he asked me for a chromatic scale in 3rds, and, again, the technique used for classical guitar at that time could not execute what other instrumentalists were doing. By the next week, I had figured out a way to play 3rds at the accepted tempo. Thus we went, week after week, and I continued to solve the difficulties to his satisfaction. Eventually, I had developed a revolutionary technique for the guitar. As a result of the experience, I have come to understand one thing:The minute a guitarist decides he or she is a genius, and pridefully refuses to enter when the door is open to a qualified teacher, is the minute when that guitarist has brought his or her art to a dead end.""You may also wish to look up Yepes's three-fingered scales/trills techniques (www.blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendID;=145762269&blogID;=376067508 ). Most guitarists are clueless as to the mechanical/technical theory of this (they think it is just repeating a m i over and over again). But it goes with a mechanical theory that is ingenius and (as all great ideas) so simple and logical, it is amazing that no guitarist in the hundreds of years before Yepes ever realized this theory. And that is just one of the many new techniques Yepes invented. You may add your ""citation needed"" comments to call this into question, but it will not take away the facts of Yepes's achievements."	0|0|0|0|0|0
"Problems with articleLet me see...what does the article tell us about Gamos? It is an ""organisation"" - whether a group of volunteers, random nomads, or a business is unclear. It does, though, have ""enabling frameworks"" with a named UK governmental group. The nature of an enabling framework is not specified. Perhaps it just means financial connections? The referenced corporation website (Ah! Gamos must be a corporation!) is filled with similarly non-specific language. Why is it notable? Well, apparently because it somehow ""provoked a multi donor action"" dealing with African phones. One assumes that this sort of provocation is a good thing, but this is not quite clear. And, further, it was, in some fashion, responsible for a ""Good Practice Paper..."".Please, someone, this article desperately need rewriting. It is not really intelligible as it is. Plus, even though some references have been provided to indicate that Gamos exists, there is very little there to show any significant notability. I am replacing the notability tag.

I also opposed the inclusion of Ovadia Yosef, but I also think, there is no need for two writers / prosaists in the collage. Therefore I proposed (s. above) to replace one of them, either Kafka or Sholem Aleichem, with someone from a different field, e.g. Leonard Bernstein. Alternatively, I would also propose Janusz Korczak to have someone related to the Holocaust.	0|0|0|0|0|0

" April 2008  You should wait for others to write an article about subjects in which you are personally involved. This applies to articles about you, your achievements, your band, your business, your publications, your website, your relatives, and any other possible conflict of interest. Creating an article about yourself is strongly discouraged. If you create such an article, it might be listed on articles for deletion. Deletion is not certain, but many feel strongly that you should not start articles about yourself. This is because independent creation encourages independent validation of both significance and verifiability. All edits to articles must conform to Wikipedia:No original research, Wikipedia:Neutral point of view, and Wikipedia:Verifiability. If you are not ""notable"" under Wikipedia guidelines, creating an article about yourself may violate the policy that Wikipedia is not a personal webspace provider and would thus qualify for speedy deletion.  If your achievements, etc., are verifiable and genuinely notable, and thus suitable for inclusion in Wikipedia, someone else will probably create an article about you sooner or later.

To view the details on the Netto site click the above link, and click About Netto in the bottom right corner. Since Netto is a Danish store, I assume that the numbers on the Danish page are the most updated, and that the other country pages are translated from it.  | talk  Arson The Keighley store was destroyed by arson as well, in about 1998. Of course, before it burnt down baked beans were 7p. After it burnt down, they went up to 10p because they were cooked.lol is that a joke or is it serious? if joking its funnyIt is true that the Keighley store burned down, it moved out to Crossflatts while it was being rebuilt. The bean prices, though, were just a joke that were being passed around at the time.   Request for info review I've just had a look at this selection and I don't think it should belong in this article.  This is the sectionThe cause has not yet been identified but it is believed to have been started by a faulty heater. The fire broke out at around 4am and firefighters from around the area were called to battle the flames. The fire was not completely put out until about 12pm. It is not yet known whether the building will be demolished and rebuilt. Netto is famously associated with good value but there is a definite negative connotation linked to the supermarket chain associated with cheapness, being mainly a food shop for the lower working class. It is becoming very popular with schoolchildren who often claim that a fellow classmate shops there, as to insult the receiver (due to Netto being known for its cheapness). My view is that it is unescessary information and the negative connotation section is an indirect attack at Netto.  I personally have never got that impression myself or heard those connotations and they do not need to be in this article surely?   The schoolchild quote is again not needed in the article.  This is an encyclopedia not a local news paper!! Please let me know your views because I am tempted to remove it  No responses so I gather we are in agreement.

Kabul Province It is not possible for 60% of Kabul to be Pashto-speakers. That number makes no sense. The government of Afghanistan is not as reliable as outside sources since it is currently dominated by Pashtuns. In all scholarly sources Kabul city is described as a Persian-speaking city. Kabul being a Persian-speaking city alone makes the whole province Persian-speaking majority. 60% is against commons sense. Even most Pashtuns in Kabul speak Dari-Persian over Pashto.	0|0|0|0|0|0

Kimberly Billett While first reading this article I was slightly overwhelmed with the amount of information. However as the article progressed, I continued to see an increasing amount of methods (both right and wrong) that I recognized from first hand experience. Throughout high school I was continuously asked to tutor children (typically students between first and fourth grade) and so one of the most commonly used methods was the additive method. The children I tutored, especially the younger ones, found it difficult to distinguish when to use the multiplicative method versus the additive method. Originally I found this frustrating but reading this article, and in particular the section on the ‘Mr. Short and Mr. Tall’ experiment, made it clear as to why the kids didn’t understand. I am also studying astronomy in which we are studying Newton’s universal law of gravitation and hence this was one of the more interesting and appealing sections of the article for me. That being said, I think the author could have expanded upon this example by describing, for instance, the inverse square law in which tripling the distance between the objects would weaken the force of gravity by 3^2 and explaining so people who haven’t covered the subject would understand.	0|0|0|0|0|0

Furthermore, unless you can show me what is considered advertisement, as I have strictly adhered to all wikipedias policies, I will continue to contest your proposition for deletion of both Sheiks of Sheba and Giuseppe Cotteli.

" Error becoming acceptable The most common error that I see regarding the use or misuse of the plural noun is the use of the word ""emails."" Email, meaning electronic mail, is both singular and plural. Someone may receive one piece of mail (email) or many pieces of mail (email). Since it would be incorrect to say, ""I received lots of ""mails"", it is just as incorrect to say, ""I received lots of ""emails."" The problem I see with this is that the use of ""emails"" has spawned a growing acceptance of the misuse of plural nouns in general. It is amazing to see in both the written and spoken word, how educated people increasingly misuse the plural noun.  For example; take some time, on any given day, and listen to the dribble that comes out of the mouths of news reporters.

This is ridiculous; such a condition does not exist according to any policies or guidelines. It isn't my fault that you can't see the obvious. I haven't seen you blocking Grandmaster when he accused Azizbekov of being a sock, claiming it’s so obvious in spite of the fact that he has provided no such evidences at all. Azizbekov was consequently banned when Vartan discovered that he was a genuine user. Neither have I seen you block him when Antranikpasha was claimed to be a sock, again without any evidences provided. As a consequence, Andranik was ALSO banned. I have better things to do than wasting all my time at a time like Christmas and the days following to document further something which is so obvious. I also find it weird that all your interventions have always been to support one side against the other as can be confirmed by your edit history.Accusations without convincing evidences are what should be condemned, like those of Grandmaster’s every time a genuine user appears. Accusations should exist when we are facing with an obvious sock, which is the case with Ehud. And I will not be waiting weeks until you read anything at all, this condition is unacceptable. And I will not be contesting my block either. I know it will be plainly rejected or the request being ignored until the block is waved. I don't expect anything anymore. Its plain fishy, Vartan gets the restriction, I get blocked the next day for ridiculous incidences which is absolutely nothing in comparison with what has happened with Atabek.It should be obvious that a block is too harsh of a punishment for accusation of sock-puppetry, especially when there is an ample amount of evidence of such sockpuppetry. Furthermore, a block should be preceded by an official warning on the user's page, with the clear notice that the user will be blocked next time. A simple request on other pages doesn't satisfy this. And also, just because the administrators have not concluded that a user is a sock-puppet, doesn't mean there is no basis for such sockpuppetry. -	0|0|0|0|0|0
2012 (UTC)If you want a famous actress, why not Olga Kurylenko? She was born in Ukraine, speaks perfect Ukrainian and more importantly says she's Ukrainian. I would even say she's more famous than Jovovich or Kunis and  who are maybe better known in North America, whereas Kurylenko is well known throughout the world. She's definitely better known than Vera Farmiga.  As to Daria Werbowy not being well known, I strongly disagree.  Just to give some persepective, Daria had 47 Vogue covers,( Gisele Budchen, certainly the supermodel had ~90, Cindy Crawford 50 covers); was 6th on the Forbes list of top earning models of all time (http://www.forbes.com/2011/05/05/top-earning-models_slide_12.html) Maybe it's a gender thing - Daria is definitely well known among females.   03:02, 11 September	0|0|0|0|0|0

De Rais was a Marshall of France, after all, there were bound to be some who could not countenance the idea that he was capable of such crimes.

Considering this article is about a Canadian train, used only in Canada, I don't see the point in using both unit systems. More so when the conversion between them does not work (i.e. the mileage per gallon versus the litres per 100 km). Moreover, Canada is using the metric system since the 1970's; therefore, the engineering specifications are probably in metric units as required by law. Anyways, that's my two cents on the issue. 75.98.19.140	0|0|0|0|0|0

"There was a lengthy discussion here (n.b., I'm not joking when I say ""lenghty"", please be careful if attempting to read it all) where some editors involved agreed that citing the film as a primary source is acceptable and others did not. There is a template (Template:Cite video) that can be used to cite a video available though a URL but, obviously, you'd have to be sure that the URL steers clear of Wikipedia:Copyright violations. Personally, I would suggest not to use the film as a source for this sort of thing because secondary sources are always better, if available. Also, you want to avoid violating WP:SYNTH which is done when you present a conclusion that you reached yourself by citing a primary source. But, if you do decide to cite the film as a source, you can use reference #68 from this version of Children of Men as a guide of how to format a citation to the actual film.

PWS-22 and PWS-23  PWS-22 & PWS-23 Hi Halibutt,Excellent to see more polish aircraft articles, but there seem to be some issues with these two:The subject matter hardly warrants such detailed articlesA single article to cover both would be sufficient as they were VERY closely related and differed mainly in size and engine arrangements, i.e. merge them.A variants section to explain the differences between the BN3, and T variants.Try to use your own prose instead of parrotting references.Avoid adding superfluous details, such as the various competing aircraft which should only get fleeting mentions at best.Just some suggestions, but if you look at the articles again objectively you may see my points.

It was quite obvious once you knew to look. The faces were camouflaged in the bark at the top of the tree. It was clearly a reference, a comment, and an inversion of the Beatle’s Sergeant Pepper album, which John Wesley Harding musically was as well, being a retreat from the sonic experimentation fueled by ""Pepper"" and a return or a retreat to a simpler, sound.

", 24 July 2009 (UTC) No, I didn't liken you to a dog. That's just an expression that means things are going downhill, IOW civil fringe POV pushers are being handed concessions and being allowed to do things their own way more and more, in spite of recent improvements in the way we're supposed to handle fringe beliefs. In this case allowing a one-sided POV driven and dubious interpretation of a guideline to be used to violate my userspace. That was indeed uncivil and very impolite. Bang! Done! No discussion or request. I am shocked and disheartened by these actions by someone I respected. That's all. Was what I said uncomfortable for you? Sure, but not incivil. You have chosen your agenda and it is not incivil to point out what it is. You do it to me all the time without me running to mommy and complaining about incivility. When you're getting your way, you are very tough and civil. Somehow you expect that you can tread on people and just get away with it by calling their comments ""incivil"". You really do misuse that card by playing it too often. When you become perfect, then you can start pointing fingers. Keep in mind that you have the dubious honor of being considered one of the most classic and highly skilled cases of a disruptive civil POV pusher. As I recall, you may have even been the pioneer developer of the technique. Your civility covers an agenda that is counterproductive to NPOV by inevitably seeking to wikilawyer, stonewall, and censure anything negative about chiropractic, no matter how well sourced, when we're actually supposed to follow the sources. That's just wrong. Since this is Tim's user page, it's probably best that this discussion not continue here (or even continue at all, since we never get anywhere). I just wanted to set the record straight that I certainly wasn't comparing you to a dog. I actually do have much higher opinions of you. I admire intelligence. I just wish it wasn't being used for such a nefarious and and non-NPOV purpose as ""to protect chiropractic's reputation"". In the real world that is good from your POV (chiro advocacy and protectionism), but here we follow the sources and let them speak.   14:12"	0|0|0|0|0|0
, 5 July 2014 (UTC)Oh noes. How will I ever recover from you not giving me any respect. Perhaps I'll reflect on the fact that a) you're a total moron who wouldn't know a true benefit to Wikipedia if it hit you in the face, and b) most, if not all, of what you know about me has been filtered through the grubby hands of Future Perfect, et al. They control what version of the truth you see here. The sad fact is, you don't have a fucking clue about what I've been doing. According to Future, I've been accusing Werieth of being a sock, without evidence. Which in his book is trolling/harassment. That's his version. Back in the real world - see all that evidence on Wikipediocracy - I've been trying to post that here from day one, because I came up with it. The reason why you can't see it anywhere here, is because corrupt bastards like Future know that for every Wikipedian who has a clue, there's plenty who are as retarded as you, and will believe him when he says it never existed, and that I'm a troll. I can't spell it out any more clearer than this - he never wanted Betacommand banned, he never wanted Werieth exposed. Just do the fucking math, or forever be his loyal subject, whose only true freedom is to lick his (jack) boots for the iron in the dirt. Seriously, if you're goal is to persuade me to not lift a finger when I figure out what Beta's next account name is, you're the one doing a 'stand up' job.   22:35	0|0|0|0|0|0

Some faecal matter Hi, Mathonius. I am no expert on human faeces like yourself but I was wondering why content like this is allowed on Toilet paper but not in the Anal cleansing section of Human feces: Elsewhere, wealthy people wiped themselves with wool, lace or hemp, while less wealthy people used their hand when defecating into rivers, or cleaned themselves with various materials such as rags, wood shavings, leaves, grass, hay, stone, sand, moss, water, snow, maize, ferns, may apple plant husks, fruit skins, or seashells, and corncobs, depending upon the country and weather conditions or social customs. In Ancient Rome, a sponge on a stick was commonly used, and, after usage, placed back in a bucket of saltwater. Several talmudic sources indicating ancient Jewish practice refer to the use of small pebbles, often carried in a special bag, and also to the use of dry grass and of the smooth edges of broken pottery jugs (e.g., Shabbat 81a, 82a, Yevamot 59b).

That said, I don’t have a strong objection to “Georgian script”, which would at least be an improvement, and seems to line up with the Latin and Cyrillic articles (the latter seems to me particularly worth emulating) in comprising a range of regional & historical varieties.—1479 "	0|0|0|0|0|0
"Whilst Dr. Beck asked only that we take down the BDI-II, I still have to pay $4 a copy for the original BDI-I so I must assume that's under copyright and licence as well. I'm going to try and find some relevant bits from WP:C to justify (or not) removing the links. From what I can see the relevant text is here: Linking to copyrighted works""External sites can possibly violate copyright. Linking to copyrighted works is usually not a problem, as long as you have made a reasonable effort to determine that the page in question is not violating someone else's copyright. If it is, please do not link to the page. Knowingly and intentionally directing others to a site that violates copyright has been considered a form of contributory infringement in the United States (Intellectual Reserve v. Utah Lighthouse Ministry). Also, linking to a page that illegally distributes someone else's work sheds a bad light on us. If the site in question is making fair use of the material, linking is fine.""From what I can tell, I think that the sites that are hosting the BDI-I and BDI-II are violating copyright. Most of them don't say that they have permission to use the instrument, they don't cite the original paper, and in the licence when you buy a copy it explicitly says not to make electronic copies. Now each of these separate users may have made a licence deal with Harcourt individually, but it seems unlikely. A lot of the google hits that come up are appendices and lecture notes from university projects; I don't think there is an exemption for educational use, but then university psychology departments often buy a ""portfolio"" of test copyrights for limited use. This would not normally extend to use on the web however. In terms of next steps, I actually think this is one of the rare occasions where a consensus is not the way to go, but rather we could list the issue at WP:CP?If it's an issue of helping depressed people, I'm not sure having people just fill out the form will do them much good. After all it just produces a number, it's only useful in context. One option would be to have a link to a therapeutic community as these may be of some help . For instance, MoodGym is a site which allows users to self-administer cognitive behavioral strategies .(Will go next to type-written letter from Oliver Sacks about cycad toxicity in Guam and the link to ALS...)

Crash of 87 Since more then likely nobody here is aware of what caused the Cash of 87, here is the short version. Volker, who tamed the inflation of the 70's by the simple method of NOT PRINTING MONEY, had retired and Greenspan had been appointed his successor.The markets, were nervous about the new face and to prove that he could be tough on inflation like Volker, Greenspan tightened the money supply after he took over, resulting in higher interest rates. Stock Markets and the economy go BOOM! when interest rates go up.  Greenspan took over in August of 2007, interest rates go up, and 2 months later the market crashes. There you go!

Irvine never said all Irish Catholic fathers were this way, he simply suggested the figure for that group might be higher than average. He might bring the ""apple of discord"" to wikipedia in some peoples minds, no doubt his political opinion is very inconvenient to the majority of ""irish"" wikipedia editors. Kind of a bitter pill to swallow when they are out there in force, in talk:Gerry_Adams, praising the man to the heavens who led a terrorist organisation that killed friends of mine, and friends of every protestant in Ulster. Fair play to irvine, wikipedia needs more great men like him to add a bit of neutrality to the discussion.   "	0|0|0|0|0|0

"Some Wikipedia editors have proposed that Wikipedia article content should be in proportion to article count. In other words, if there are 5 articles about Suburban Express about history, competitive battles, etc., and 20 ""articles"" (blog posts, mostly) about the recent newsy trash that 80% of the article should relate to the recent newsy trash. One big problem with that is the fact that many of the blog articles are simply regurgitated from one seminal article or two. In other words, if there are 20 blog articles, there may be 18 that are essentially copied from the initial two. If the body count method of assigning weight is accepted, duplicate/regurgitated articles should probably be ignored."	0|0|0|0|0|0

"==GA Review==:This review is transcluded from Talk:Air India Express Flight 812/GA1. The edit link for this section can be used to add comments to the review.Reviewer:   ""which at around 06:30 local time on 22 May 2010,"" - You should note which time zone it is referring to when it says ""local time"", or better yet, just put the time in UTC. Some references are in the wrong places, because it looks like some statements are unsourced. This is the situation in the following statements:""Initial reports from survivors suggested a tyre burst[6] as the aircraft attempted a go-around."" - Move reference #6 to the end of the sentence.""800 feet (240 m),[54] well before the aircraft made a touch down."" - Move reference #54 to the end of the sentence. ""and also of the alleged hostile attitude of the airline's counsel.[80] Members of the Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) along with Kasargod MP P Karunkaran staged a protest on 8 September 2010 at the airline's office in Mangalore where they submitted a memorandum to officials demanding that families of the victims receive early and equitable settlements of compensation due. They also demanded the settlement process be made more transparent by opening it to the media rather than holding sessions in camera."" - Either the reference (#80) is in the wrong place, or this statement really is unsourced.The units of measure are inconsistent as to whether it is American first or metric first (e.g. 2,000 feet (610 m) and 90 metres (300 ft); they should be American first and metric last or vice versa, but not both).Some of the references contain errors:Reference #12 is missing the date, which was May 8, 2011 (the bottom of the page says it was last updated on that day).Reference #14 is a bare url and is missing all information. BTW, why is it linked to a plane crash in 1981? Reference #16 is missing the date (27 April 2011).  There is a typo in the title on reference #20, it should say ""158 die, 8 survive in Air India Express plane crash in Mangalore"", not ""159 die, 7 survive"". Reference #24 is missing the publisher (The Hindu) and the date (16 December 2006). Reference #28 is missing the date (24 May 2010).Reference #29 is missing the author (Chand, Naseeb).  On reference #31, add the author either as ""CNN Wire Staff"" or ""Singh, Harmeet; Neisloss, Liz; Razek, Raja; Deaton, Jennifer"". BTW, you have the wrong title, it should be ""Air India's flight data recorder sought"". Reference #33 is missing the author (Mines, Javier).The url for reference #42 redirects to the video homepage, and not what it was intended to link to. Reference #43 is missing the date (27 May 2010).Reference #50 is missing the date (3 August 2010). Reference #51 is missing the author (Proulx, Jim) and the date (21 May 2010). The url for reference #57 has a similar problem to reference #42. Reference #58 is missing the author (Nandy, Chandan) Reference #61 is missing the date (26 April 2011). Reference #64 is missing the author (Raghuram, M.). Reference #69 is missing the author (Fernandes, Ronald).Reference #73 is missing the author (Hradecky, Simon) and the date (26 April 2011).

As I said, there's nothing wrong with comparing an editor with a demonstrably anti-Semitic bias and a demonstrably pro-conspiracy theory bias to the Nazis. Sure, Mike Godwin would probably disapprove, but I think even he'd admit that's there's nothing fallacious about such a comparison. Yes, it's uncivil. But we don't block for incivility any mroe.

"OMG, you are an imbecile.  Seriously.  Let's go over this one last time on the remote chance you might finally understand the difference between fact and opinion.I rewrote the contribution using ONLY information that I found on the Internet that supported the contribution.  I did not add anything to the story that could not be verified through a reliable source.  YOU, on the other hand, wrote a contribution that DID add content to the story that could NOT be verified through a reliable source, making it YOUR OPINION.  You said things like  ""... when a neighboring police agency was needed and requested by the chief of police to intervene in the criminal conduct of Arvada's police force.""This is libelous, because you accuse the Arvada Police Department of ""criminal conduct"" when no criminal conduct has been proven in a court of law.  Even the officer who is alleged to have done the hitting has been found ""not guilty"" by your peers. Because no one is convicted in the link you provide (or ANY link ANYWHERE on the Internet), it is your OPINION.  If you had used the phrase ""ALLEGED criminal conduct"" you would be more on track.You also wrote: ""Arvada's city council had chosen not to intervene in the previous criminal conduct of several members of the Arvada police, despite a cost to the city of close to half a million dollars defending the criminal actions of one police officer alone, during a period of budget crises.""The ""close to half a million dollars"" was NOT spent ""defending the criminal actions of one police officer alone.""  The money was spent settling OUT OF COURT so that the accusations had no opportunity to be proven as fact.  A ""criminal"" is someone who has been CONVICTED of a crime. So there cannot be ""criminal actions"" unless someone has been convicted of a crime.  There CAN be ""alleged questionable actions,"" which is what you should have written. When you post hateful things about others that is just your opinion, that opens you up to a LIBEL SUIT.  If you do it in a blog, and you make it clear that you are expressing your opinion and not facts, you can say whatever you like there without much fear of libel.  But when you post to a site whose premise is encyclopedic content, you cannot just post what you THINK.  You must post what can be VERIFIED.   Do you understand this very basic principle?  Please read it again if you don't, because I'm done trying to educate you.Definition of libel (I encourage you to visit the link and read all its contents):  http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-libel.htmLibel involves false statements knowingly presented as fact. In the United States opinion is protected as a tenant of freedom of speech, falling outside the purview of libel. Citizens retain the right to comment on public figures and entities, including government and officials. Entertainment, parody, editorials and criticisms that may arguably misrepresent facts are not libelous so long as they are presented for amusement or stated as mere opinion. From:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DefamationHow to prove libel:  There are several ways a person must go about proving that libel has taken place. For example, in the United States, the person first must prove that the statement was false. Second, that person must prove that the statement caused harm. And, third, they must prove that the statement was made without adequate research into the truthfulness of the statement. These steps are for an ordinary citizen. ________________________You are unable to be objective about the content you are writing because you have a personal, emotional feeling or opinion about it.

This article doesn't suppose to focus on defining consciousness, it only supposed to describe the aspects of consciousness what are relevant for AC, and why they are relevant. I don't know whether AC would exactly be a superset, but I think that it would describe that what is objective, and therefore most likely common in different possible types of consciousness. I don't also see why R2-D2, C-3P0 and HAL are artificial consciousness, and don't see the reason why they were added. I added Vanamonde, what I think is a good example of AC, and Jane, what was mentioned to be artificial sentience.

I've been doing this as one of my principal activities for 7 years now, and I“New Peugeot Glenmarie 3S Centre” learned I can not maintain a high standard if I do more than 20 or so of the same thing at a time, for any WP process. Some people manage 50. Except for correction of trivial errors, I don't know of anyone who does many more than that  successfully. And certainly not for 7 or 8 hours at a stretch.It's not that you make many actual errors. It's that you don;t follow up what other things the contributor may have written, and that   you are almost always content with the form notices. I too use them most of the time, but when I see someone who seems to need assistancewhether the assistance is to stop trying the impossible or advice about what specific kind of referencing will help the article, I don't wait for them to come to my talk page, but give it.  You do help them when they come here, but most people won't do that. They just go away. What we need to do to keep WP going is to get more initial contributors to remain active.

"Actually to clarify....after Bret Hart was forced to vacate the world title(and retire) due to a concussion, the planned Hart vs Sid Vicious title match was changed less than 48 hours before the match to Sid vs Benoit. Since there was no time to build up the match it was decided to do a screwjob finish, and then build to the rematch at Superbrawl the next month. So benoit ""won"" the match(with Sid's leg clearly on the ropes), and then the next night on Nitro the decision was overturned. The official result of the Sould Out 2000 Main Event was ""Chris Benoit and Sid Vicious fought to a no-contest"". End of story. Except not. Pissed off at the shitty booking, Benoit confronted booker Kevin Sullivan(who benoit had a personal history with re: Nancy). Sullivan then told Benoit if he didn't like the booking he could ask for his contract release no questions asked. benoit took him up on it and jumped to the WWF. The difference between this and the millions of other screwjob/Dusty finishes was that rather than the belt seemingly moving from one champion to the next, then being handed back....the bgelt was vacant before Benoit ""won"" the title, thus the overturning of the decision made the belt vacant once more. Sid also had a seeming title victory only for the result to be overturned due to his ""pinning the wrong Harris"". Officially at the time the belt went from Hart to a vacant state to Kevin Nash awarding the belt to himself........Okay, so Vinnie Mac has bought at WCW and recognised both Benoit's and Sid's first wins as World Title Wins. He has also recognised Hulk Hogan's two AWA Dusty Finishes as official World Title Wins. I don't like it, but I guess it's official now. The obvious question is, since Vince owns WWE, WCW, ECW and AWA can he, say overturn David Arquette's WCW World Title win at this point? That's just stupid.The SandmanThe Sandman won the ECW Championship FIVE times, not one as the article shows!WWA World TitleWhere did it go?"	0|0|0|0|0|0

" Kenneth McKellar Please don't leave snide and snooty comments for me about ""poorly referenced"" edits. I attended Kenneth McKellar's funeral in 1997. He was a very dear friend of my families and my parents were devastated by his death. His funeral was held in the cathedral in Glasgow. A memorial followed some weeks later, which was attended by Donald Dewer, First Minister of Scotland. I am sorry that there is no ""reference"" to say that he died, and I can't recall the exact date, but nor is there a ""reference"" to say that he was ever born.

You will find a very long discussion there are realize that the recent inactivity was due to several persons (including ISKapoo & Vikramsingh) giving up any hope of maintaining a balanced viewpoint due to the constant censorship of ITAQALLAH and others.  Are you sure you understand the tags you've put up? There is clearly no controversial or unsourced content in the article that  alludes to. This looks more like a heap of tags just to say you don't like the article as it stands. Neither you nor your colleagues have given any detailed reason why the removal of crankish, poorly sourced, fringe material contravenes WP:NPOV, and how the material isn't in violation of WP:BLP (whereas I have shown it is).  Please stop vandalizing this article by removing the tags. Your behavior has become a burden on most wikipedians. -   Please demonstrate that you understand the issues at hand and are not merely placing tags so as to register your personal grievances with the page. You can do so by actually explaining how the tags are justified and how the fringe material removed doesn't violate core content policies.  User:Agnistus has claimed the neutrality of this article is disputed. That is legitimate. Now, I'd like to now what is it in the article that Agnistis finds to be a violation of WP:POV. I advise Itaqallah to give the user 24 hours (or the next time he signs on, whichever is earlier) to produce his/her reasons for placing the tag. Thank you Agnistus for your anticipated cooperation.  Dear , you do not know that the article is disputed? ""crankish, poorly sourced, fringe material"" ???. The statements by Zakir Naik on the rights on non-muslims were properly sourced material of much importance to the article(to maintain a balanced viewpoint). You have repeatedly and continously indulged in deletion of this material. Your actions have constituted a blatant violation of WP:BLP. Read the 50-page long talk page and you will understand the reasons for the disputed status. You are probably blind to this gross censorship since you yourself were the censor. Until and unless a fully balanced viewpoint is presented (ofcourse in compliance with WP:BLP) in the article, the tag cannot be removed. BTW  , there is absolutely no necessity for a 24-hour window, as it is perfectly clear to any Non-Islamic fundamentalist from the talk page that this article is totally disputed. And if you (ITAQALLAH) still feel the material that you censored was ""crankish, poorly sourced, fringe material"", then please visit: , ; and please read the articles on Zakir Naik in ,  and . -   Agnistus, I can only gather from your response that you have little basis in policy for inserting your tendentious unreliable material or what amounts to a pointish protest tag.

"4. This last summary is partly from chapters two, three, and four in Haslett, B. B., & Samter, W. (1997). Children communicating: the first 5 years. Mahwah, N.J.: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc. The main idea for chapter two, Nonverbal communication: its origins and development, is the awareness of events around the child such as gaze and gesture interaction, facial expressions, and modifying emotional expressiveness. ""With age, children's encoding (sending messages) and decoding (interpreting messages) skills increase. Yet children are better at decoding than at encoding, a fact suggesting that nonverbal comprehension precedes production"" (Haslett, B. B., & Samter, W., 1997, p. 35). This fact represents interpersonal communication and how it improves with age in children. The main point for chapter three, The development of language, is the social development based on the environment of the child. ""Children's nonverbal communication skills, especially those developed through interactional synchrony with adult caretakers, foreshadow the conversational exchanges that typify interpersonal communication."" (Haslett, B. B., & Samter, W., 1997, p. 57) Good interpersonal communication starts from the beginning with infant communication, mainly nonverbal, and so it translates to the developmental skills to attain high levels of communication. This chapter also touches on stages in language development which is a slight alternative idea to explain parts of interpersonal developmental process. The stages include prelinguistic development, speech perception/production, semantic development, private speech, and first words. Also, the main idea for chapter four, Developing verbal communication and how its relevant in children's acquisition of a variety of communicative strategies for attaining goals. A main focus is ""discussing the communicative intentionally substage of development"" for infants ""emerging abilities to control their communicative skills"" (Haslett, B. B., & Samter, W., 1997, p. 105). All three chapters contribute to a more concise understanding of language how it contributes to the ideas of interpersonal communication development in young children.  "	0|0|0|0|0|0

"Can you please try to see the glass being half full instead of half empty.  I'm certainly not trying to do anything that you or others would see as ""problematic"".  Five weeks ago I was getting involved in wikipedia and I was feeling enthusiastic, so I posted something to some user groups (reaching 10,000+ members), encouraging them to contribute to wikipedia.  I thought, at the time, that long-time wikipedia people would be more welcoming of new people, and that wikipedians would be happy that I encouraged others to participate.  I was not trying to target and encourage employees of a commercial product to contribute.  The groups I posted to were user groups, not employee groups.  But yes, I guess that some employees belong to these groups as well.  And my comment about Hill using the talk page was simply to comment that my personal POV is that he found a good way for someone with COI to contribute. I feel that the negative and accusing tone of your last sentence is unwarranted. It is un-welcoming comments like that that drive away new wikipedia contributors.  I see my wikipedia contributions as a way of giving unselfishly to the world, trying to spread knowledge and improve understanding.  I think that even if I only have time to make a small number of contributions, I feel I am helping, and that this should be the spirit of wikipedia.  So seeing your criticism that I am not making enough edits to non-commercial products is just frustrating and disheartening to me.I hate feeling that I have to defend my reputation here, and I don't agree with you that editing non-commercial pages should improve anyone's appearance of trustworthiness.  However, your claim that I am only editing the wikipedia entries of ""these commercial products"" is also just incorrect.  I don't know if there is a way to view the wikipedia contributions of others, but if there is, you would see that I've been making edits to many non-commercial pages, including CRISP-DM, Data mining, the journal Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, Predictive analytics, Statistics, Customer retention, Predictive Model Markup Language, Anomaly detection, SEMMA, Machine learning, Jacques Cousteau, SIGKDD, Decision tree learning.  Sometimes I'm making simple formatting edits, and sometimes I'm spending hours trying to track down the right references to put on the CRISP-DM page.  Yes, my edits are mostly in the general area of data mining, because that is where I have the greatest interest and knowledge.  Similarly, when I guest lecture at local universities, I lecture to these types of classes, not due to any collusion, but because that's what I know.Thanks for listening to my mini-rant.  I know I'm taking this more personally than you probably meant it.  But it bothers me when someone questions that I am not working hard enough or they question my ethics, and that's what your comments feel like.  All I'm asking is that long-established wikipedia people be more welcoming and encouraging, and give new people the benefit of the doubt that they are acting in good faith trying to make meaningful contributions (however small).  New people grow and adjust - but it takes a while to learn the conventions of the wikipedia community.  Please be patient and encouraging to new people.I'm going to leave this discussion now.  If needed, I will return to it after the holiday season.  But I hope there is no need to.    "	0|0|0|0|0|0

"Sure. I don't have the necessary knowledge to correct these sections. The most egregious error is the following statement: ""His system of government, which may be described as a benevolent despotism, was perhaps that best suited to the character of his subjects."" This passive construction raises the questions: benevolent for whom? described by whom? It implies that the Montenegrins were unable to govern themselves and needed a wise father to gently raise them into civilization. If this is true, it needs a citation, but I'm sure there were plenty of trade unionists and republicans who disagreed at least slightly ;-)The following phrases read as excessively fawning, slightly biased or perhaps just worded in an old-fashioned style:""the young highlander, whose keen patriotism, capability for leadership and poetic talents early displayed themselves, showed no inclination for the pleasures of the French capital, and eagerly looked forward to returning to his native land.""""He gave Montenegro its first constitution in 1905 following pressure from a population eager for more freedom.""""King Nikola was gifted with a fine physique and a commanding presence, was a successful military leader and a graceful poet""I hope this helps so that someone who has the knowledge to do the edits can update the article accordingly."	0|0|0|0|0|0

I think LordAmeth has good point, and I wish koreans and japanese would come to terms that they are not that different.  the solution is either that koreans forgive japan for what happened or for japan to apologize and do what Germans did.  Neither is happening and frankly it'd make more sense for japanese to do their part first than the koreans. as far as authoritarian violent gov is concerned, don't be a naivete, japan has its own agenda, and so do all the other countries involved. it's korean necks that are on the line, and many of them smarter than all of us statistically speaking, feel that Japan is a bigger threat than n.korea, then i guess it is unless japan assuages korean sentiment which is pretty easy to do in practice.	0|0|0|0|0|0
if they destroy each other they both don't live up to it. irresistable force means nothing can stop it. immovable means the object can't be moved. in both cases beign destroyed contradicts that. something like that means it was a powerful force meeting an equally resistant object. the problem is the adjectives that are absolute. just like the god examples and the greek dog. god can't be absolute if he can't do everything. creating something he can't oppose is something so if he can't do it he isn't absolute but then if he can then he isn't abosolute because he can't oppose it and so can't do everything. Laelaps was a dog that always gets what it hunts but Jupiter turned it into a static star while it was hunting a fox. since it can't ever move again it can't ever catch the fox and so it doesn't always get what it hunts.	0|0|0|0|0|0

":Now I've checked, and, unfortunately for ""true"" enthusiasts, Steinberg does not call this work a ""true choral symphony"". He calls it, in fact, ""more a cantata than a symphony in the ordinary sense"" (p. 655). (Hard for a piece to be a ""true choral symphony"" if it's not even a ""true"" symphony.) There is evidence that Vaughan Williams would have agreed with Steinberg and was using the term symphony in the title more or less figuratively, roughly in the manner that Stravinsky later used it in his Symphony of Psalms. From Ursula's biography, p. 95: ""On of my [Ralph Vaughan Williams's] most grateful memories of George [Butterworth] is connected with my London Symphony....he [Butterworth] said in his characteristically abrupt way: 'You ought to write a symphony.' From that moment [a ""moment"" well past the composition and first performances of A Sea Symphony] the idea of a symphonya thing which I had always declared I would never attemptdominated my mind.""

"As a matter of curiosity==As a matter of curiosity, if a person with a Circumcision Fetish found his way to this article, would they be allowed to edit it as an authentic observer?  By the way, the circumcision in front of the grass hut on page 5 of the WHO pamphlet, ""Global Trends,"" would indicate that the purported HIV protection targets village people who live in primitive conditions.  Would that also target the English-speaking readers of a wiki site like Wikipedia?  ...  Anyone ever hear of an educational foundation known as the Gilgal Fellows  perhaps an entry in this article could describe their work.    Unfortunately it appears anyone may edit the article regardless of a conflict of interest.  I have also questioned the relevance and impact of third world African HIV studies on our modern audience to no avail.    Thanks for the link to a conflict of interest. Since there are a number of fellows who edit this article, it would be helpful to know if any of them have information about the Gilgal Fellows described here  It could be revelatory for Circumcision Wikipedia to include a section on the Gilgal Fellows, who apparently have quite a mission.  It's my understanding that GILGAL is an obscure word for MOUNTAIN OF BURNING FORESKINS.     No one having objected to the proposed sections on Circumcision Fetish and the Gilgal Fellows, I will assume a consensus, delegate the research, and get back here with it ASAP.    It's impossible to assess such a vague proposal.  If you provide some specific, sourced content, we can assess its suitability.    ""...we can assess...""  Now would that be the Royal We or you claim to speak for other fellows?   ""We"" refers to myself and others who may be interested in evaluating the proposal.    All the same, I don't get why YOU in particular deigned to represent the other fellows without asking their permission. It'll take a lot of Human resources to put these sections together... and if the ""consensus"" is already fixed in advance, what's the point?   Perhaps it's a little presumptuous, but it's realistic.  It's usually a safe bet that more than one person will comment on a proposed change; take a look at the archives if you want to confirm that for yourself.As for your proposals, previous discussions have found that there are no reliable sources discussing a ""circumcision fetish""; searching Google Scholar for ""Gilgal Society"" indicates that there are no reliable, secondary sources regarding that subject either.  So I would think it doubtful that content could be written in a way that conforms to our policies.    ""Our"" policies?... You mean the Gilgal Fellows?  I'm not certain WHO you're representing here.   Wikipedia's policies, obviously.    Another reader deleted this interesting discussion for some reason.  In trying to improve the Circumcision article, it's important that we discern between authentic readers and those who are paid a salary to patrol and manage this article.  That's not a personal attack, nor a lack of presumption of good will.  It's merely being realistic about who finds their way to this controversial article, and a healthy cynicism about some readers' intransigence.  One reader has left a very rude & domineering comment on my user page.  If personal attacks like that are the norm, I can only assume that a number of fellows are paid to patrol this article, and its objectivity should be flagged on the title page.   =="	0|0|0|0|0|0

Heaven of God To understand Heaven, then God must be understood: 1.  God is the all powerful supreme being of the Universe.   2.  Universe is defined as everything that is seen and unseen, and defined as everything known and unknown.  Any concept of a multi-universe shall be defined as the mathematical subspace where there can be many subspaces, but only one Universe.  A mathematical subspace is a subset of dimensions that does not have to include all other dimensions.  The subspace we exist within can be a subspace of a larger subspace.  The subspace that includes all dimensions is the Universe itself.  The Universe itself is a subspace that includes all dimensions. 3.  God is either above the Universe as the creator, or part of some subspace of the Universe, or both above and part of the Universe.  The fourth condition that God is not part of the Universe, and God is not above the Universe negates God's existence; therefore, the fourth condition is not considered a valid condition of God. 4.  God is supreme over the Universe.  It is God's creation and obeys God's rules.  Each rule can be obvious or non-obvious, and each rule can be hidden or allowed to be known. 5.  God has the ability to create and destroy energy.  Without such a thing, then the Universe simply exists and is eternal and everlasting with no known explanation of its ability to exist; there can still be God as a supreme being of the Universe in such a condition, but God's energy ability is changed to the ability to manipulate energy without the ability to create or destroy energy. 6.  God is smart, is intelligent, is wise, has knowledge, is a creator, is good, is benevolent, has mercy, and has understanding.  God has these abilities that are significant as the supreme being of the Universe.   7.  God expects God's creation to do well, since as a creator, then the Universe was created for God's purpose and enjoyment; therefore, life elements of God's creation, such as people, are expected to improve their own condition for their benefit and exercise wisdom, understanding, and knowledge when possible to exercise such thingsintelligence is good. 8.  Because God is supreme, then Heaven and its rules of existence are defined by God. 9.  God not only deals with people of Earth of our Sol system of the Milky Way galaxy, God is a supreme being that can interact with the entire Universe in whole, or God can interact with the Universe in part; therefore, God truly understands some of the issues and survival strategies of life, and this implies that God may be truly forgiving and God may expect certain behavior for the improvement of ourselvesto survive and prosper is important.  10.  It is always believed that God likes people, so help from God can be asked by petition for help or intervention using prayer.11.  God likes to be acknowledged from God's own creation, so it is good to acknowledge God as the benevolent intelligent creator of the Universe.12.  Love God.  Love is a survival strategy of people that helps to define society, family, nation, benevolence, and many good things of life.  Be who you are as a person and love God, and God is expected to understand this as love is part of the defining qualities of people. God has created the Universe and has the ability to define Heaven in any way.  Each person can get a personal Heaven, or Heaven may be a interaction for people, or Heaven may be a combination of both personal and interaction of people.  Heaven is always defined as a good place; but, a personal Heaven can also be a personal Hell tailored to your life, attitude, and existence where God could give us, by observation, an environment where the individual prospered.  The personal Heaven and Hell would be much like an metaphorical ant farm that is designed for ants, but you would not expect things like body building equipment in the ant farm, and the ant farm would function in a way ants survive, and this can be bad news for people who were ruthless where their environment was ruthlessness as a survival strategy (visit a zoo and see how the environmentshowever limitedare tailored to the different animal species).God can define Heaven in any way, and Heaven is defined as a good place, but as a supreme being God can allow many things, and maybe God might include a body building set for the metaphorical ant farm, so the possibilities of Heaven are expected to be many, if not endless possibilities.  God is benevolent in Heaven and the possibilities are many.  Love God.	0|0|0|0|0|0

" Theoretical justification for our tax system? I added this sentence to the lede...""The two main theories of taxation are the benefit theory and the ability to pay theory.""...which ‎Guest2625 removed with the explanation that this entry doesn't contain the ""terms"" used in my sentence.  There's a theoretical explanation for the world's current tax system...either that or we're all crazy.  If you're saying that this entry doesn't at all discuss the theoretical basis for our tax system...then clearly that's a problem.  You don't solve that problem by removing the one sentence that does mention the justification for our tax system...you solve it by creating the section that does provide the justification.  In order to do that...you first have to review all the references that I added to the benefit principle entry.  If you're not willing to make that effort...then please don't edit this entry. Having already read through all those reliable sources and many many many more...here's my take.  This paper...The Pure Theory of Public Expenditure...by Paul Samuelson has been cited over 5,000 times.  It provides the definitive theoretical justification for our tax system.  Samuelson's argument was that the benefit principle had a very limited scope because of the preference revelation problem...a problem which tax choice effectively solves. That's it...that's our tax system in a nutshell.  That's the bottom line that readers should not have to wade through miles of minor details to find.    "	0|0|0|0|0|0

"  The USA under the Confederation may have had the same name as the modern-day USA, but it was not the modern-day USA. The USA (Confederation) and the USA (Union, or also called ""nation""), are different entities. The argument can be made that while the USA (Confederacy) was a ""firm league of friendship"" among a number of ""free and independent states,"" the USA (Union) was a separate political entity that, although it replaced the USA league, was something completely different. Saying that the Articles was the first constitution of the USA, and then providing a link to the (modern-day) United States, is misleading. My point: The article as it currently stands is incorrect because it asserts that the Articles was the constitution of a union that did not yet exist, although the political body in place did have the superficial similarity of having the same name.And the verifiable reliable sources which support my interpretation are the Declaration of Independence and the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union.Perhaps I didn't express my convictions eloquently enough to be understood, since the differences are not easy to distinguish.

It doesn't seem to me that your Wikipedia history is a particularly good one. You own Wikipedia page shows evidence of potentially hundreds of agravated users. I think what you are trying to say is that in 8 years you have never been caught outright and had your account banned. I would say given your behaviour here and your past history shown by your own personal page is that it is likely is that you have border-line trolled for a number of years. But that is just to say that your history contradicts what you say. I've been quite clear about this right at the start, and I've let you know as soon as I felt you were crossing the line. At this stage I warned you and pointed you to wikepedia guideline on trolling.[] The specific policy you may be in breach of is vandalism.[]. I am alleging that your behaviour amounts to trolling. You are threatening in effect to vandalize my work. What you are trying to do is in effect bully me to change my work to fit your personal POV. That is plainly a breach of Wikipedia policy and guidelines. If you think I'm somehow getting it wrong and your behaviour is perfectly innocent then by all means go to those sources you yourself suggest. If you come back with a clean bill of health then I am prepared to revise my view. If you get a reliable source to review your posts here and they give their expert view that I am wrong, then I'm quite happy to remove the allegation.With respect to the citations, I am the author and so if you are unhappy with the sources I've used and having brought it to my attention but failing to find agreement after having discussed the matter it is up to you to consult a reliable source who is prepared to support your position  something I've suggested now a number of times. Otherwise we will keep the article as it is. Particularly as it has been alleged that you are trolling, an allegation which it appears you do not dispute (discussing a variety of 'possiblities' does not actually address the allegation). Particularly, its important that you refrain from making any changes until the allegation has been cleared up. If you don't I intend to follow the Wikipedia guidelines on how to deal with vandalism caused by trolls.	0|0|0|0|0|0

Relaunch 86This was to judge by appearances. As theoretical physicist Robert Grumbold puts it, “It took two decades of IT to reveal what the Cantab editors were really up to, but it’s now clear that their achievement was staggering. Basically if each letter of a Cantab article is plotted as a point in an n-dimensional space, then you find that the piece on the piece on Benjamin Zephaniah, written in early 1988, actually traces out an encrypted set of instructions for twisting vortical gravity fields to produce a singularity in ψ-space. And the City Issue of Summer 1988 is decades, if not centuries ahead of its time. The uninitiated were evidently deceived into seeing nothing more than a shameless piece of careerist self-aggrandizement in the hallowed Cantab tradition. “In fact”, says Grumbold “this is no less than a prototype of a 13-dimensional machine which time-locks a 9-dimensional black hole. We can see the equations but just don’t have enough neurons to even begin to figure out what they really mean”. But where was the portal and why did it have to be closed? Was it in the paste-up room cupboard? Had interdimensional creatures from another universe been progressively using it to control the minds of the film reviewers in 1985/86? Is it true that at 1.41 am on 23 May, 1988, a packet of chocolate Hobnobs on the layout desk suddenly shot across the room and disappeared into the wall? Why did so many people go into the nearby round church and so few come out? And why did so few people go into the nearby Indian restaurant and so many come out? Who or what was the Chief Editor, who subsequently disappeared in South America? Did (he) come from an extraterrestrial civilisation so advanced that trade journalism is unknown there? And why does supernatural sleuth Mike Dash repeatedly censor any attempt to tell what really went on so long ago, years after he’d left Cambridge? What is his dark secret? Had he already experienced something that has tormented him ever since and prevents him from getting a life even today? This is evidently one mystery too many, even for him….

"Language and Mind-set of a Popular 1950s MusicalI have removed the ""Language and Mindset..."" section of the article. The whole section is *very* subjective, depending entirely on your point of view, and  could be applied to plenty of films from that era. Further, none of the information there was cited. I am posting the section here in its entirety for reference.   Language and Mind-set of a Popular 1950s MusicalSome parts of the film might be considered racy or questionable now, though a recent viewer can place it in the mindset of 1956: Crosby’s character sings a love song to an eleven-year-old girl (his ex-wife’s younger sister who still has quite a crush on him);  the father of the bride discusses the attractiveness of his daughter's body (while upbraiding her for having no compassion, as most characters in the movie have already or soon will);  and several cases of real and imagined extramarital sex (separated from the movie-going masseswho might not at that time be participating in such exercisesby all characters being part of, or by necessity having to interact with the Newport upper class). When Tracy Lord (played by Kelly) awakens hungover on her wedding day, she doesn’t at first remember anything about her previous night’s drunken carousing, but comes to believe she “made love” with Mike the reporter (played by Sinatra) and discusses it at length with her ex-husband Dexter (played by Crosby). At the time, of course, ""making love"" was generally understood in a more amorous than sexual sense. Being a romantic comedy, “High Society” plays all of this for laughs while cheering for the real loves to uncover themselves by the end of the last reel.There are also some very interesting issues of class in the movie, as Kittridge, the up-and-coming coal magnate (and fiance to the current mine owner’s daughter), is described as having worked his way up from being a miner, and clearly is flummoxed by the confusing interactions of those born into the upper class, as is Sinatra's journalist character."	0|0|0|0|0|0
" Will Arbitration finally be needed to stop the bigoted attacks?

" Vandalism on B-theory of time It seems perhaps I have been going about this the wrong way, so I will try to be helpful and explain WHY your last edit was vandalism.First off, the description intro, the quality of the intro had been greatly increased, Naming McTaggart as the founder is just repeating was is in the origin section, hence there is no need for it. The description gave a better just of what B-thoery of time is a whole. Undoing this completely is therefore vandalism, ESPECIALLY if you don'y first talk about it in the talk page before editing.Secondly, you removed 'description', you then deleted the description as in metaphysics, changed the better, updated version of the physics part, then moved it in the origin section. There really is nothing I can say about this, I have no idea what kind of twisted reasoning could be behind that move?!....Thirdly you removed this section: It is noted by Dean Zimmerman in 'Presentism and the Space-Time Manifold' that A-theory is 'almost certainly a minority view among philosophers', while B-theory has 'achieved broad acceptance'.http://fas-philosophy.rutgers.edu/zimmerman/Presentism%20and%20Rel.for.Web.2.pdfIt seems you perhaps have a personal agenda, favouring A-theory therefore editing in favour of it, this is not allowed on wikipedia, and it is vital to keep a Neutral point of view. The above statement however, is correct and cannot be removed simply because you do not want people to see it.Finally, and on the most relevant side, you Craig information, it is an improvement that you have put the Craig talk in an oppose section as opposed to to the description section.However a lot of it is not quoted, rather you have stated the opposition as out right fact. Such as...""The B-Theory suffers the same incoherence as all theories that time is illusory, namely, that an illusion or appearance of becoming involves becoming, so that becoming cannot be mere illusion or appearance. The Buddhist can consistently deny the reality of the physical world, since the illusion of physicality does not entail physicality, but this is not the case with temporal becoming."" You stated this outright. This is an OPINION of Craig's it should be demonstrated as such, I also do not believe it belongs on the page and it is an obvious dig at another religion. In fact you have stated all of Craig's OPINIONS as fact.If you want to make edits, please first discuss them in the talk page, and we can talk about whether it is relevant or not, and how it should be worded.DocHeuh  "	0|0|0|0|0|0

UPittIT Block Hi Orangemike,Hope you are doing well and I appreciate your work here on Wikipedia. I have some questions regarding the block of UPittIT. Although I too have some concerns with this account which primarily are the lack of this editor's responsiveness to numerous warnings of copyright concerns (as Hammersoft had pointed out), and editor's lack of engagement in dialogue regarding these issues. This could be simple misunderstanding of the copyright policy for the editor's user space, but the repeated violations are disconcerting. In fact, I can't be entirely sure that the user account is only one person (a kind of reverse sockpuppetry that makes me uneasy). However, it is my understanding that editors are not in WP:COI solely due to their place of employment or username, but rather because of the issues of POV, reliability and neutrality of their contributions. However, in this case, my particular my concern is the work the editor had done in his or her own sandbox (the now deleted  issues, this had not been demonstrated because all of his/her work (as far as I know) had been confined his/hers user sandbox. The editor was an obvious newbie, and had twice sought feedback (see here and here) and had been responsive to suggestions demonstrated by the removal of pervasive external links, downsizing of the article, rewriting so it was not in violation of WP:NOTDIR, and the addition of outside, neutral third-party references. In fact, although I did not see any of the editor's additions to this particular article since July 7th, in my opinion, it contained useful information, was notable, and was ready to be moved from the user space into Wikipedia proper. Mostly, I would request that this page be restored, as I would like to create that particular article myself and will not be able to duplicate the off-line references from various library science journals that had been inserted. I guess you could say that I primarily lament the loss of this particular article. I would appreciate your thoughts on this issue, and your review of the D-Scribe Digital Publishing article circa the July 7th version as I would like to see if there is anything salvageable from that (sans the copyright violations that Hammersoft elucidated). Thank you.	0|0|0|0|0|0

Bishonen: Sorry but this is just more of the same and I offer no appeals, regrets or retractions. As I said, the goal all along was to block dissent to POV pushing under the guise of Wikipedia rules. As a longstanding editor I knew this and the consequences of telling the truth even though indefinitely banned having demonstrated my point about wiikipedia corruption and even though I never made any edits to the article in dispute and the comments were not addressed to the harasser and wiki stalker but a warning to a more naive editor who did not realize what they were up to. I have nothing to lose and predicted the harassment would succeed if challenged so let others with less experience and more misplaced AGF illusions be warned about confronting establiished career editions pushing POVs.	0|0|0|0|0|0

"""millions were killed on their way to the west"" is an example of German home-made history. The total number of German victims wasn't ""millions"" and many of the victims died of infections.

Yes, yes, yes! But the academic treatment has been done. There are thousands of pages of published documents.

Thank you for the discussion. ) I may have worded it wrong. Even though officially Latin is not used in the City-State in the same way as the Holy See, leaving only the Italian translation can also mislead readers to believe Italian, English, etc are only used there even in documents, and the average reader will still tend to confuse the two entities of the Vatican City State and Holy See together even after reading the article (even I do!).

DKW racing engine of the 1930s I remember reading about a DKW racing motorcycle engine with three cylinders but one combustion chamber.  In essence, the two outside cylinders were mounted vertically and formed a Twingle or split-single unit, while the middle cylinder was mounted horizontally (facing forward in the frame), had a larger bore and a smaller stroke, and was essentially a supercharger for the other cylinders.Does anyone have any documentation for this engine?  I think the motorcycles it powered were successful racers at the time.	0|0|0|0|0|0

REPLY: Many distributors say not to use chlorine bleach nor cationic sufactants (fabric relaxers, fabric conditioners).  AIUI too high a concentration of bleach may distort the fibers [please confirm].  The cationic surfactant will fill the holes in the microfiber and reduce its efficiency.Similarly microfiber should not be washed at too high temperatures (eg 80 celsius).  However it is hard to get microfiber to release the dirt it holds and so the method of washing needs to be a bit of a compromise.Do not wash with other garments especially those which shed small particles of fiber as these will be taken in and held by the microfiber cloth.There does not seem to be a case for using special detergents.Again, some will advocate using a drier but the temperature must not be so high as to distort the micro fibers.  I would not want to iron or press washed microfiber because of the possible loss of the dirt traps.Some distributors will suggest the use of bleach (eg 3M and its Scotch-Brite microfiber kitchen cloths) and others will specify rather high temperatures.  Perhaps their microfibers have been treated or manufactured to withstand such washing but I am not sure how it could have been achieved.http://www.microfiber-products-online.com/faqs.html	0|0|0|0|0|0

"Peer ReviewAs others have mentioned above, the tone doesn't seem to be encyclopedia-like, its more of an educational piece on what happened from your view.  In the opening section you write ""This operation was the result of wary parents under the newly instated Castro Regime who did not want to give up their parental rights to the Cuban government. Largely unpublicized for fear of being viewed as political propaganda, this underground operation eventually became the largest recorded exodus of unaccompanied youth in the Western hemisphere."" That is a very hard claim to substantiate without any sort of reference. The whole Demographics of Minors section could either be put in another section or completely deleted, because earlier you already state the children were Cuban, and their parents didn't agree with Castro, so it is in my belief their religion's and social status don't matter enough for its own section.- eo"	0|0|0|0|0|0

" Pope Francis article: quote from Jerusalem Post editorial Hi, Herzen!  Wanted to make sure you saw that I reverted an edit you made on the Pope Francis article, asking that the issue be discussed on the talk page. I did change the sentence you had deleted to reflect the fact that it came from an editorial (not an ""article"") in the Jerusalem Post. Sorry for my mistake!!! (Guess it was my sloppy thinking, just categorizing ""editorials"" and ""news articles"" as different types of ""articles"".)  However, I think it's a really wonderful quote, only positive. The Jerusalem Post is a highly respected paper representing the views of an important segment of the Jewish community: those who live in Israel.  If we talk about relations between this pope and the Jewish community, I think it's great to have a quote from a paper like that, basically saying that this pope has been in a place that gave him a chance to have a rich relationship with the Jewish community  perhaps richer than any previous pope. Anyway, I think it's a very good quote in a section that addresses the pope's prior relationship with the Jewish community. I hope you'll reconsider your objection.  In the meantime, I have asked for the opinion of other editors.  Hope we can all agree! Best wishes, and thanks for all your good work on this article.   "	0|0|0|0|0|0

If we REALLY don't want to do ANY original research, many parts of many articles in wikipedia should be deleted.

" POV Tag Vandalism? David Starr has re-posted the POV alert tag on this page. I do not feel he ever fully addressed my questions. He is asserting that the page shows overwhelming bias in some way - according to him there are only two specific single line instances that he cites of bias on the page, both in the bio. This does not a biased page make.I have clearly refuted both of these claims at length, with no response (despite repeated requests) from Starr. 1) The ""garbage"" passage is balanced with an explanation from a Da spokesperson. The source is quoted, phrase is neutral, and source (scholar Georg Feuerstein) is not in dispute by Starr. The mention is crucial because it explains the ""controversial"" aspect in first line of lead, and period is alluded to in Adidam apologies for ""controversial"" earlier behavior and in the numbers of lawsuits, news articles, and analysis by authorities linked to and discussed in Da page. Also, further explained by Da himself in ""Crazy Wisdom"" section in teaching.2) Mention of 1986 breakdown/Divine Emergence. This is a significant event, as attested by Adi Da press. Source is not biased, all mentions of events are phrased neutrally within basic journalistic standards. Balanced with Adi Da self-assessment as personally significant event (about which an entire book was written.)3)""Undue weight"" was shown to be unreasonable, as each line is short without subjective exposition. On balance throughout page, all potentially ""controversial"" material (in every case sourced, cited, and neutrally phrased) is far outweighed by neutral info and Da ""self-assessment."" Every potentially controversial mention is carefully contextualized and phrased to reflect source, and balanced with an alternate explanation. In every case. Source disputes:1) Gurdjieff Journal: no specific instances of bias are alleged by Starr from this source. Starr is simply questioning the source without saying why it is an issue. Did not address my point that source is only used because it summarizes bio info from Da, Rudi, and Siddha Yoga accounts. No bias is reflected in WP entry, no has any been revealed. And Starr has failed to show how magazine is biased or ""self-published"" simply making assertion that it is a ""competing religious organization"" which is simply unproven (there is no Gurdjieff church or ""organization"").2) Lake County News: source has been used for other articles, Starr only questions it for single mention that he subjectively finds to his dislike (the Divine Emergence passage). He has not worked to find alternative source that would allow the material about a significant event to remain. Source has been found acceptable to all other editors in past months, as demonstrated by its repeated use. Starr cannot singly enter now and discount source, when not showing WP guideline that effectively discounts it (only his own subjective analysis of the quality of the ""contact"" page on their website.)All other editors, including myself, have been involved in give an take on this page, making allowances and corrections for each other - even yesterday I made changes to accommodate other editors, including Starr. I do not feel that Starr is meeting this standard, and in particular completely failed to address my repeated specific requests. Because of this, I am removing the POV tag as vandalism and an attempt to discount page. I have requested third party review, and perhaps further dispute resolution.   "	0|0|0|0|0|0

"I could have been ""reminded"" too but was banned and then threatened by you in response. The policy here is often to ban first and ask questions later. I think I am just about done with Wiki. It is a laughing stock of an encyclopedia lampooned daily in the press and print world. ""The Onion, Daily Show, Colbert Report"" have all picked on it for just the kind of thing I encountered daily as an editor here. It seems that censorship is the core issue behind almost all of what afflicts the site yet when it is called out by a fellow contributor, it gets some phony ""we are all friends being neutral"" rhetoric lobbed back and no progress is ever made. You say you are following the ""rules"" even if you are, there are higher rules like ""truth"" which should trump the petty stuff but that whole ""just following orders"" excuse is so typically self defeating it embarrasses me to say I am human. At what point does a person ask the tougher question like ""what is the truth"" and hold that question to a standard that trumps all other things? Example: That is why men get hanged when a Judge decides DNA evidence won't be used. No one is interested in truth, they would rather hang an innocent than seek or pursue the truth. Does it matter that the DNA evidence came in on a Thursday at 4pm after the evidence cut-off time for that judges jurisdiction or does it matter more that the evidence shows clear innocence? You would be the guy saying, ""3 revert rule"" clearly states no evidence therefore all that follows is inadmissable. You are that guy who gasses Jews and says, the rules as you interpeted them suggested that was within the guidelines laid out by the almight founder of ""Wiki"" and you are the guy strip searching 80 year old women on airlplanes in search of bombs because the ""rules"" clearly state search everyone.

"Hello Ratnakar Kulkarni, thanks for the swift reply.  What about this, ""He became a celebrated hero in Britain among most of the people connected to the British Raj,[3] but unpopular with most Members of Parliament[4]""My reason for suggesting this is that 247 MPs voted to forcibly retire Dyer from duty with only 37 MPs voting to keep him.  Later, a Dyer supporter (Carson) attempted to pass a motion of mild approval of Dyer, but was defeated 230 MPs (against approval), 129 MPs (pro-mild approval).  This suggests that a majority of MPs was against Dyer.  All this is covered in the reference 4.  Please let me know what you think, I think adding what I suggest above would balance the introduction, yet keep it short.   "	0|0|0|0|0|0

"Not precisely. You can say Persian Empire crumbled after battle of Gaugamela when Mesopotamia was taken, or after Bessus killed Codomannus, but battle at Persian Gates is completely irrelevant in context of Achaemenid fall.

You can't accuse me for anti-Hellenism because I've edited many Greek pages. Battle against Porus was Macedonian victory, but also not ""decisive victory"".It's nonsense to say ""Alexander did conquered Persia, but Persians didn't conquered Greece"" - fact is, Persia fought wars only against Athens and Sparta (and their minor allies), and they razed Athens during Xerxes' invasion. Perhaps you didn't know, but Macedonians sided Persians during that expedition. Alexander is not Greek in ancient sense, but Macedonian (also not in modern sense, but ancient).

Gilles TréhinI have listed this article at WP:DRV for possible undeletion based on information I have received regarding a book that has been written by Trehin about his fictional city, Urville.  Interested parties should contribute to the discussion.  Is this still deserving of featured article status?I'm beginning to think that this article should be removed from the list of featured articles.  It seems to me that political ideas and attempts to be politically correct have compromised the factual veracity of this article.  This should be a pretty straightforward article about a neurological disorder like epilepsy or aphasia.  Instead, it reads as if Asperger syndrome is either some kind of blessing or lifestyle choice and that there are negligible drawbacks to having it.  The very fact that many of the participants on the talk page take issue or offense at even calling AS a disorder or disease when it is viewed as such by the medical community is rather telling.  I really think the mainstream medical and scientific view should be emphasized, as medicine and science strive to have the neutral point of view that this article lacks.  I'm not looking for an argument.  I'm simply warning those interested that if this article stays as it is I will probably lobby to have it removed as a featured article.	0|0|0|0|0|0

Firstly, how is posting a single ANI a rampage? Secondly, Codf1977 is not 'semi-retired' but 'retired'.

Hi, the Kart Maliks were based mainly in Herat but they were also from other part of modern Afghanistan and yesterdays persian Khorasan. They claimed themself as descends of the Ghurids. When the Il-Khanatas took the power of the whole iranian plateau they accpeted them as their neighbours so they were able to rule self in Khorasan. Just Samarkand and Bukhara and maybe Merv was under the il-Khanatas while the mst of the plateau were under their own hands, even modern Pakistan.Generally we can say they were a sub-ordinated dynasty..but an indenpendent one unlike other dynasties or nations. I just don´t know who to deal with both because both dynasties were ruling in Greater Iran..	0|0|0|0|0|0

" Christian Slater's family tree Regarding edits to the article on Christian Slater, Oct 28 and 29 of 2009, I reversed your edit because:The edit by 166.216.128.16 added mention of ""English and Irish descent"", but also truncated the long standing paragraph on the fact that Helen Slater is no blood relation to him.  As you observed, the paragraph made no sense after that hack job.In my opinion, the original paragraph touched on a point of interest, one that people might consult an encyclopedia to confirm or deny, and offered verifiable facts that attest to the extistence of a point of confusion (i.e. co-starring in ""The Legend of Billie Jean"", and misinformation published on a DVD of ""Supergirl"").Now you have reversed my reversal.  I suspect you've done this in reaction to the mutilated version left by 166.216.128.16.  If you review the edit history between say Oct 26 and 29, and appreciate the original (and long standing) version of the paragraph, I leave it to you to bring the article back to that state again, as I'm loathe to reverse the reversal of my reversal.Thanks for considering this.   Censored Comments on ScorceseI would appreciate it if you didn't delete my comments on talk pages for personal reasons. No editors were attacked and WP:BLP is for ARTICLES, NOT talk pages.   Your statement ""there is a contingent of editors that feel the need to hide the fact that there are actually famous people in Hollywood that support child rape"" is most certainly an attack upon a ""contingent of editors"" which include the ones who have acted against your campaign to accuse multiple persons of supporting child rape, all the while ignoring the comments regarding reading the actual petition and trying to understand the actual difference between supporting Polanski's actions and protesting the manner in which he was arrested. And for the record, WP:BLP most certainly covers talk pages. See WP:BLP#Non-article space, which says ""Contentious material that is unsourced or poorly sourced and not related or useful to making article content choices should be deleted, and even permanently removed (""oversighted"") if especially problematic"". Both your claim about editors' motivation and your statements against Scorcese are attacks. Please try to contain your bad faith.    You guys are delusional. I'm sorry that your celebrity hero worship blinds you to the fact that Roman Polanski raped a child and that is not okay. Maybe you should stop watching so many movies and go outside and watch the sun shine. It's not even worth it anymore. Have fun guarding your precious Hollywood articles from anyone that you slightly disagree with.   No, delusional is thinking that because someone disputes the manner in which you present your viewpoint, it equates to being in favour of raping children, and that's not the first time you've made that type of comment.  That's delusional.  My disagreement with you is more than ""slight"".   If I notice you make any comments that go against WP:BLP or that attack editors, I will revert them, but that is the only interraction I ever want to have with you.   Please do not leave any further messages on my talk page, and as long as you don't make any further inflammatory comments, I'll have no reason to bother you.

While it's true that, for example, a proto-sound like *p is a ""phoneme"" and that it may be represented as */p/ when pronounced as such, it's not true that these symbols are simply interchangeable with IPA notation. The phoneme *h2 **CANNOT** be represented in IPA notation as */h2/ whatsoever because ""h2"" is not a valid IPA symbol! Depending on the theories of the IEist in question regarding the pronunciation of *h2, however, the sound may be represented as some universally recognized IPA symbol (such as /x/, for example, a velar fricative).

"(edit conflict).  I am very exasperated by the rant above.  I have really tried to respond to all of your points, Jugi, but I don't think you will be satisfied by any reply other than complete agreement.  I am sorry if I accused you of anything you have not done; I apologize.  Let's go back to your sentence about the accuracy of MEMRI's translations.  I asked you to reproduce your refs on the talk page for the sake of clarity of discussion, but instead of helping me out by doing that you spend screen after screen berating me for not answering you.  OK, here they are:   ^ a b Mayor of London Press Release ^ a b c d Yigal Carmon Osama Bin Laden Tape Threatens U.S. States memri.org, 1 November 2004 ^ a b Ramona Smith, ""Did Osama send election threat?,"" Philadelphia Daily News (2 November 2004).Carmon Whitaker email debate.  OK, Let's discuss these refs: Livingston press release is unacceptable as a RS on this.  Livingston does not have any translation expertise in Arabic.  He is therefore not an acceptable cite on the accuracy of translation. You are using CArmon's own translation to say that MEMRI's translations are inaccurate?  That is quite bizarre.  Ramona Smith-I don't know what more I can sy about this. She is talking about the binLaden tape.  I believe the only person she quote with any translation expertise is Cole.    Al-Jazeera, the most prominent Arabic news source iin the world translated the same way MEMRI did.  Juan Cole disputed the translation after the fact saying that binLaden was not using standard Arabic and also disputed their interpretation.  No one in the world excpet for binLaden knows what he meant to say in that tape.   This is not enough of an example to generalize from.  Could you consider reproducing the part of the Whitaker piece that refers to the accuracy of translation here for discussion?  I have read those articles a fewtimes, and believe that Whitaker came up with one minor example.  I also note that you keep inserting a Cole quote and his blog is not an acceptable source for this article.  Finally, You want to use headings ""selectivity"" and ""bias"" and then place quotes under one or the other that contain sentences which contain both types of crits.  I split up some of the quotes so that the ideas of the critics would come under the appropriate headings.  You object to this and say your version is more ""well written"".  I disagree.  I'm not sure what more to say about this.  Elizmr, it does not help our conversation for you to refer to my statement to you as a ""rant"". And it does not help our conversation for you to falsely accuse me of doing things I have not done (as you apologized for above), NOR to falsely accuse me of NOT doing things that I HAVE done (as you just did above). I DID provide references to my citations above in this talk page more than a week ago, but you never responded: See Here. I even made the links easy to use: simply click on them in the text I added.Elizmr, lets discuss them in the order you cited. The first is a ""Mayor of London Press Release"", published by the Greater London Authority City Hall and available on the london.gov.uk website. Do you claim that this is not a RS? Your objection that the Mayor of London (Livingstone) is not personally a certified translator is absurd: this press release is available from the City Hall in Arabic and other languages, so clearly he did not prepare this document personally, but with the help of a staff that spoke Arabic. Would you try to deny a statement by George Bush about Iran in a WP article because he is not personally trained to translate Persian? Your argument is just plain silly.I am using Carmon's statement to prove to you that the Cole dispute was about translation, since you were questioning that above. MEMRI's president makes this statement: ""the U.S. media in general mistranslated the words"". So clearly he considered this dispute to be about TRANSLATION.Ramona Smith published her article about the Cole dispute in the Philadelphia Inquirer. Do you claim that this newspaper is not a RS? In her article she writes: ""That supposed warning to 'red states' was lost in muddled American translations released with the video last week, the Middle East Media Research Institute claimed. But translation problems or no, experts at a variety of prominent think tanks disagreed with the idea that bin Laden was preparing to sort out safe states from target states.""

"ΚΕΚΡΩΨ, somehow you missed these objective criteria that are recommended to be used:  ""Is it the official current name of the subject? (check if the name is used in a legal context, e.g. a constitution)"" Yep, it's in the constitution. ""Is it the name used by the subject to describe itself or themselves? (check if it is a self-identifying term)"", Yep, it's self-identifying term. And let me quote something else from that policy:  Subjective criteria (such as ""moral rights"" to a name) should not be used to determine usage. These include: Does the subject have a moral right to use the name? Does the subject have a legal right to use the name? Does the name infringe on someone else's legal or moral rights? Is the use of the name politically unacceptable?This pretty much invalidates most of arguments used by the Greek side. What remains that FYROM is more popular than Republic of Macedonia? That has not been concludently proved and might not be even important since. 1. it's not established that FYROM is used widely in English, 2. we have a self-identifying term that doesn't need disambiguation, so where is the problem to use ""Republic of Macedonia""?

" AndyTheGrump, Is THE REFERENCED AND PUBLISHED Decision of EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS (ECtHR) not a PUBLISHED RELIABLE Source? Notice that I am giving the ECtHR reference DIRECTLY from OFFICIAL ECtHR website. 212.174.38.3    European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) Decision On The 1915 Armenian Event This must be added to the article:On 17 December 2013, (the case: Perinçek v. Switzerland (application no. 27510/08)) European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) punished Switzerland for criminally convicting Mr. Perinçek for publicly challenging the existence of the Armenian genocide. Perinçek said ""Armenian genocide is an international lie"". ECHR punished Switzerland for violating Perinçek's right of freedom of expression (Article 10). ECHR referenced three decisions on its verdict: a. In November 2007, The Spanish Constitutional Court had found unconstitutional the offence of negation and had taken the view thatthe mere negation of a crime of genocide did not constitute direct incitement to violence. b. In February 2012, the French Constitutional Council had declared unconstitutional a law which made it a criminal offence to deny the existence of the genocides recognised by the law, finding it to be incompatible with freedom of expression and freedom of research. c. The United Nations Human Rights Committee had expressed its conviction that “[l]aws that penalize[d] the expression of opinions about historical facts [were] incompatible with the obligations that the Covenant [on Civil and Political Rights] impose[d] on States parties ...” and that the “Covenant [did] not permit general prohibition of expressions of an erroneous opinion or an incorrect interpretation of past events”.ECHR ECHR punished Switzerland for criminally convicting Mr. Perinçek for publicly challenging the existence of the Armenian genocide (Perinçek said ""Armenian genocide is an international lie"").I hope now that the researchers can freely and without any fear research what happened in 1915.Notice that in 2013 ALL Ottoman Empire archieves are open to the researchers and any researcher can freely read ALL the archieves and documents in Turkey.However, Armenia still does not allow its archieves to be searched and reserached. 212.174.38.3   Intolerance and Impatience of Armenian (or close to Armenian) Guys About the COUNTER ideas on 1915 Events The user Erpert THREATENED TO BLOCK me in my talk page (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:212.174.38.3) via the pretext that ""1. using of talk page for inappropriate discussion"", ""2.

"  Krishnendu das aka Babukishan comes from an old and very traditional Baul folklore family. His grandfather, Guru Shri Nabani Das Baul, was a much celebrated singer and poet that was instrumental in bringing the Baul culture to fame with the respected and admired status it enjoys today. Nabani Das Baul often collaborated with the writer of India's National Anthem, a great poet, and winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1913, Rabindranath Tagore. In popularizing the music of the Baul. Nabani Das Baul opened the doors for his people to the world. In keeping with this tradition. Babukishan's father, Samrat Purna Das Baul, a modern, popular legend among the Bauls, opened up the doors even further by collaborating and jamming in live performances with the top Western and European acts of the 20th century. Babu is a music designer, singer, and author renowned in India for his work in both the recording and film industries. He plays a variety of music combining new age, and world fusion, with traditional folk music in authentic Bengali Baul styleBabukishan began his career as a performer by accompanying and studying the arts with his father, Purna das Baul. He also participated in numerous youth folk festivals, traveling to places such as Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Bangkok, Great Britain, all of Europe, the United States, and Canada. He played with both the Asian Performing Arts Festival at the Royal Albert Hall in London and the Worldwide Youth Festival in Carnegie Hall in New York.From this beginning, he traveled most of the world from 1980 to 2000 as a composer, music instructor,musician. and singer.Babukishan, deeply inspired by his Father and Grandfather, knew at an early age he too wished to compose and perform. He began on the soil of Bengal but clearly he was destined to belong to the world of music. His journey started in early childhood when he joined his mother, Manju Das, and his father, Puma Das, playing and singing Baul music in global festivals. Despite the many world tours, Babu also found the time to study Indian philosophy and Folk music at the University of Kolkata where he eventually secured both his BA and Masters degrees. So it was that his formal professional career in music began with his family. He toured with Bob Dylan's The Band East & West tour in 1985. In addition, Babukishan has performed with other international artists such as Alice Cooper, Rolling Stones,Tom Petty, Miles Davis, Allan Fakir, George Harrison, Herbie Mann, Third World, Robbie Robertson, Garth Hudson and many others. Though the subsequent years, Babu put this solid foundation in music to good use by composing and performing in all areas of India's entertainment industry as well as in a variety of venues worldwide. Then, in keeping with his early dreams of a unique style of his own, he turned to the music of the western world that he had become so familiar with in his early years of performance. His use of Baul & Indian rhythms combined with the Reggae produced his own brand of World Music-Babu's New Age, Bengali Folk Fusion is the result. Babukishan has also worked with top Indian musicians/singers and music directors such as R.D.Burman, Ravi Shankar, Sultan Khan and Zakir Hussain. As a composer, Babukishan has written the music for several albums, TV serials and films, earning a good reputation as one of the most promising composer in the Bollywood (Indian cinema) music & film industry of India. In his recordings, Babukishan features folk music, romantic songs, pop songs, ghazals, Qawwali music, new age, fusion, Sufi music and bhajans (devotional/spiritual songs). He is the first singer and music composer from the rich Baul family tradition to venture into fusion music by combining Baul/Sufi music with western music and reggae music. Babukishan produced and directed two documentary films about folk music and he wrote a book titled The Bauls of Bengal. One of Babukishan's latest projects is the band ""Birds"", which he founded. It combines new age, world music/traditional folk and fusion music. His album Soulmate"" (Universal/Music India) creates a unique new generation music worldwide.and his latest album, Birds & soul mind & body are based on Baul/Sufi music.""GYPSYINDIA"" is authentic traditional baul & sufi music written/composed and all the instruments played by him.this album recored at woodstock,newyork during his tour on 2004. http://babukishan.comhttp://cdbaby.com/cd/babukishanhttp://community.webshots.com/user/babukishan"	0|0|0|0|0|0

":While many of your edit suggestions are certainly reasonable, I'm afraid I must oppose the name change and removal of the word ""murder"".  Murder is by far the most accurate and significant element of this event.  Referring to this as a simple ""home invasion"" ignores what made this event notable, specifically the premeditated murder of two people.  Therefore, the title should reflect such.  I also disagree with your assessment that ""murder"" is polarizing term or even a term of legal art.  Murder is what it is and it best describes content of this article. 98.247.53.229  "	0|0|0|0|0|0

Also, foreign couples (as in two Asians) might also have participated in that mass wedding. So the number of couples isn't precisely indicative of US church membership at the time. I can always ask Tyler Hendricks, who served as vice president for personnel before he was selected US church president. He'd have the old database. All I know is that in 2003, we had around 5,600 to 5,800 adult (""first generation"") members on file at church HQ; I know, because Hendricks gave me the list then.   02:42, 16 June 2009"	0|0|0|0|0|0

Some of his edits have been a bit uncontructive and the ""Aneditor"" deception was exactly what it looked like, deception. If you are worried, you can always play it safe in the future by being deliberately less harsh, and then seeing what the response is. That keeps the options open just like vandal warning levels do. It gives the recipient a chance to see where things are headed and the onus is on them to correct. If they don't, you will have been patient and have given due warnings.

You say distinguished i say well-known eminent Like i said above it seems fair to remove well-known, because perhaps he is mostly well-known to iranians and Iranologists. But if you still insist that he is not emiment either, and it seems that you have prepared a list of words to choose, i really don't see any reason for changing eminent, because he is in fact an eminent iranologist.However if you still insist then you might as well for example call pakistan's president not known at all or englands queen an old woman.

Also, after reading my previous comment (and the source), are you still contending that socialism isn't opposed to individualism?Your substitute is not adequate, either: therefore, it is asserted by some critics that socialistic is less individualistic.  Firstly, the use of a weasel words is strongly discouraged at Wikipedia; please read WP:AWW for more information.  Secondly, socialism is less individualistic than what?

" Julia Roberts Thanks for adding some references to this article.

Those include specific facts about box office gross, critical commentary, such as referring to something as being ""critically panned"", ""box office failure"", ""mixed reviews"" and the like. Quotes always need to have specific quotes, whether from printed sources or a verbal quote. That would seem to me to be the reason the facts tags were placed. Thanks again for placing refs.

Yes, I understood that as such. I do believe that he ought to be included in that class of Americans but as you point out, no such category has been created for that to occur. I added that to Malcolm X's categories actually realizing that after I had made the addition. However, I kept in the article because I was hoping that someone would simply add the category. However, after you reverted my edit, I relented based on your reasoning which is why I specifically added the category Assassinated People to the article - because it was an existing category. Instead, you have reverted that edit, entirely defeating the action which I had taken which was to broaden the murder of Malcolm X into not just a racial consequence, but a human consequence as well. It is the same with Martin Luther King. While each of these people were Civil Rights leaders who were assassinated they were also human activists attempting to make the world a better place who were murdered. As such I was trying to include Martin Luther King and Malcolm X along with people like John F. Kennedy, Robert Kennedy, Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru - in a broader specter of significant humans that were assassinated... However, you removed that edit. I give up...	0|0|0|0|0|0

If you care to re-write it, please focus very carefully on the actual _facts_ presented in the source, and not their spin or interpretation (CNS is quite partisan). All I could find was one fact satisfying both WP:RS and WP:V — That a poli sci prof said Kennedy offered public relations advice to Andropov.

"""To overcome these limitations, some fungi, such as Armillaria, form rhizomorphs or mycelial cords"" It was not until I searched ""rhizomorphs"" that it became clear that the term is synonymous with ""mycelial cords"". I suggest either making it clearer that they are the same or simply dropping one and keeping whichever is more prominently used in the literature.""Characteristics shared with plants include a similar pathway in the biosynthesis of large organic molecules with important roles in cellular development and for defense, called terpenes."" After rereading this sentence multiple times, it isn't clear if terpenes are involved in biosynthesis of large organic molecules and cellular development / defense, or if terpenes are involved in biosynthesis of organic molecules which are themselves related to cellular development / defense. The latter interpretation seems more logical, but if that is the case, why does this introductory sentence on terpenes complicate itself by introducing seemingly unnecessary information on organic molecules?""However, the biochemical pathways for the synthesis of similar or even identical compounds often differ markedly between fungi and plants, which is shown by studies that have demonstrated that the fungal and plant enzymes for making these compounds differ strongly in their sequence and other characteristics, indicating that they have evolved separately in fungi and plants."" This is a very long sentence. Consider slicing it into smaller sentences for better readability.""More than 60 species display the phenomenon of bioluminescence of mycelia or fruiting bodies."" This seems like a bit of a non sequitor for this paragraph. Perhaps it would be better placed in the Diversity section?"	0|0|0|0|0|0

"If someone feels that an editor has been editing disruptively, it is perfectly in order for them to report it to administrators to consider whether any action should be taken. It is a matter of courtesy to warn the user in advance that doing so is being considered, and to give the editor a chance to stop. In fact, a report to administrators is likely to be simply dismissed if no warning has been given first. I do think that more friendly wording might have been used, rather than  ""I will report you to Wikipedia admins and have you blocked"", but I have seen far more uncivil warnings than that. The IP editor has just given you that one message since your last edit to the article, and, since you say that you are ""done with"" the article, it may be that he/she will leave it at that. If the IP editor persists in posting to you about it after you have stopped editing the article, then please come back and tell me, as that may well be harassment, and action may well be needed, but if what has happened so far is the end of it, then I don't see any reason for not just letting it drop.

He apologized after the game and said that he hadn’t been in victory formation before in the NFL and thus didn’t know the proper way to kneel down (which does make sense)."""	0|0|0|0|0|0

" == Issue on images still unresolved == I appreciate your inputs in Image talk:Monkey3.jpg and I agree once in a while I might sound rude (purely unintentional, since I put facts blantly). But SlimVirgin is abusing his admin power to overrule anyone.Slim is not a ""he"". Given that she named herself after a Javanese princess, perhaps you could take the hint and note that she's a woman. Also, I don't think you were simply blunt. I think you were rude to Slim. I recognise it's a fine line but given that I've mentioned it to you, perhaps you'll take more care to stay on the right side of it?She has suggested in an email to me, that she is in talks with another editor. Now, I don't know who this other editor and i certainly don't like this secrecy. Instead of having a discussion on this, she wants to finish the matter begind closed doors. She could've atleast told me who this reputed editor was to let me have a word with him/her.Perhaps she is seeking guidance on how she should approach you and wants that to be untainted by your input. I think that would be reasonable. I have a high regard for Slim and I don't think she would have a nefarious purpose in speaking to a third party.Inso far as the images are concerned, I had stated to her a couple of images on one issue (animal rights) is ok, but she insists she needs to showcase the entire album provided by PETA and its assocites.So you have a dispute. You need to recognise that you are not necessarily right! You disagree about how many images are necessary. I feel that you have to allow that your disagreement might be fuelled by your political differences as much as how you interpret the image policy.This should could easily achieve by providing an external link to the images provided by a controversial organization.The BUAV is not a ""controversial organisation"". It is a highly respected body, whose voice is listened to in all circles of British society. A viewpoint doesn't become ""controversial"" just because you don't share it.Wikipedia is supposed to be neutral and not have extreme viewpoints - But you expect it to reflect your viewpoint.thus I requested her to limit her fair use policy in this regard to 2-3 images which can be used across similar articles. this she refuses.I don't see how it is any fairer to use one, two or ten images in this instance. While I agree that Slim could have taken more care to provide a rationale for using the images, I simply don't feel that your argument about how many she should have used has much weight. One factor in deciding fair use is how much of a thing you use, that's true, but it's only one factor, and obviously, each picture is a separate case to be considered as well as part of a whole.As far as the other images, some are on personalities she claims have ""agreed"" to use their photos here. Unless she gets a written consent and a permission how can I believe.First of all, you can believe Slim because you assume good faith. Perhaps you're not aware of that policy. Yes, you can ask Slim to provide evidence of that, but your assumption should be that she has in fact acquired that agreement. Harassing another editor to provide evidence to your satisfaction and insisting you won't believe them until they have do not show an assumption of good faith.Once I pointed out that {permission} photos would be deleted anyway, she backed off and argued that it be kept on the grounds of fair use asking me to trust her.Yes, okay. Trust her AND ask for proof.Both of us are editing in good faith, but one of us has power and a circle of friends to back her while the other (me) relies on the hope that ppl. like you will help me out in this.I'd urge you to rely on the issues rather than the personalities. Yes, Slim does have powerful friends, who will back her regardless, but you should still do your best to make it about the issue in question and not about her.If she gets away with this and sets a precedence then I'm afraid there are hordes of copyviolaters straining at the leashes to bomb Wikipedia with copyrighted information.''I think that's a bit dramatic but I agree that she has to obey the rules, which exist for good reason, and shouldn't be given a pass just because she is friends with the arbcom. However, she is not a ""copyviolater"" trying to destroy Wikipedia. Partly, I think she simply didn't understand your problem, and that was in part a failure of your communication, and partly she has become too used to having her views echoed by her friends and doesn't handle disagreement well. So perhaps you could recognise that and be more helpful than combative? I know	0|0|0|0|0|0
'Mixed-NOCs' doesn't represent any subtotal (contrary to EU GDP in your example), it is rather arbitrary mix of athletes from different countries.The current medal table serves the sole purpose of NOC comparison - and 'Mixed-NOCs' introduces some confusion into this comparison. Look, it is definitely listed for comparison here, taking its place according to its medal count (even without rank assigned). Why not to show another medal table to the right of the current medal table? And this second table would contain medals of different NOCs, won by athletes within mixed-NOC teams. Mixed-NOC competitions shouldn't be considered somewhat less relevant, so this table is also a relevant one. It is separated just because there's no valid reason to combine them together within NOC medal table, since it would compromise the purpose of NOC comparison.	0|0|0|0|0|0

"Restoring to the original version.==The article has been restored to its original B-class version before the edits by By78. The PIB article on which By78 made the edit, is incorrect that report was submitted by the army. From the article , the standing comitteed to which the report was submitted says ""There were clear factual inaccuracies in the army's deposition before the Standing Committee. The most glaring of them is the army's suggestion that it is carrying out trials on the Arjun's performance.In fact, the army has already accepted the Arjun for introduction into service, based upon its driving and firing performance over the years. After firing trials in summer 2006, the trial report (written by the army) said: ""The accuracy and consistency of the Arjun has been proved beyond doubt.""The ongoing trials in Pokhran that the army is citing are Accelerated Usage cum Reliability Trials (AUCRT). In these, two Arjun tanks were run almost non-stop for 3,000 kilometres, not to judge performance, but to evaluate the tank's requirement of spare parts, fuel and lubricants during its entire service life.""

"As much as human rights and ethnic rights should be respected, spray painting every possible detail of unverifiable information on the Rohingya, and getting around the verification by claiming that the information was destroyed by an interested party - are not valid reasons for having a list of villages where a certain group of people live. There is already a lot of articles on the Arakanese people and state that have no concern of the Rohingya but include them for the sake of brotherly respect - this is pushing the line a bit far. Rohingyas should be treated fairly - I do not contest that. But articles like this one - are pure self-pitying and clutters Wikipedia with absolutely useless information.

What proof do you have that Nowruz is Persian holiday?? You are allowing the false information to be presented to the public? There is certainly no evidence of holiday to be of persian, iranian or zoroastrian origin. I goes back to the Sumerian festival of Akitu (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akitu). Persians came to the plato along with other iranian speakers after the ancient civilisations were already established there. Aryans certainly changed the name of many geographic locations including the names of holidays. I believe any reference to Persian or Iranian must be amended with word 'Near East' or at least Iranian plate as in reference to the geographic location rather specific ethnicity.	0|0|0|0|0|0

The new theory on how Titanic broke apart Just saw the special on the history channel. Rather interesting as they have found to complete sections of the double hulled bottom and have come to the conclusion the the Titanic broke from the bottom up, as opposed to the top down as portrayed in movies and described in most accounts. This is further supported on there by the fact that the breaks in the ship match this blah blah I have no clue what i'm talking about, but this is important shit and this article has nothing in it whatsoever about it.	0|0|0|0|0|0

"::::You're certainly correct that the Kerry article isn't a direct parallel to this one.  The Kerry article reports on flat-out lies that were told about Kerry.  In many countries he would have been able to win a defamation lawsuit about the statements quoted in our article.  (American law provides a high degree of protection to people who make false statements about elected officials.)  Thus, our article gives greater currency to lies about Kerry.  By contrast, no one has pointed to any lies about Rick Santorum that would be squelched or even given less currency by the deletion/merger/renaming/whatevering of this article.  Compared to the swiftboating of John Kerry, the use of Santorum's name in a nondefamatory way is minor.  As for Streisand, if some Limbaugh nastiness about her gets the level of attention that's been given to ""frothy mix"", start the appropriate article.

Bad News Bad News: there are getting to be increasingly more Wikipedians who want Georgia (country) moved to Georgia as if it didn't need dis-ambiguation, as indicated on Talk:Georgia. Please tell them the following message (if I do it myself, the probability that they will listen is less likely because I'm not a registered Wikipedian.)This is the English version of Wikipedia. Article titles should be NPOV to regions where there is a large English-speaking population, such as the United States. If Georgia (country) moves to Georgia, it certainly is less NPOV in the United States, and the regions where it is more NPOV are in Asia, where there are not many regions where large English-speaking populations are found. It would be logical to move Georgia (country) to Georgia in the Georgian Wikipedia, but not the English Wikipedia.  16:08, 20 Jun 2004 (UTC)	0|0|0|0|0|0

" To be worked into the article at some stage Direct from the House of ZigSuzanne Carbone and Lawrence MoneyThe Age, November 15, 2006WHATEVER happened to Zig, the disgraced half of the famous Melbourne clowns? Doug McKenzie, the better half, turned up his curly toes two years ago but Diary has not heard a word about Zig, Jack Perry, until now, although we're none the wiser if he's still with us. Diary had a call from South Melbourne: the Salvos store in Clarendon Street has been selling his stuff. Kitchen chairs, a bedroom dresser with mirror, two bedside cabinets, all optimistically marked: ""heritage"" and ""Once belonged to Zig the Clown"".The lady at the counter said she had never heard of Zig and Zag but the ""men who collected it said that was where it came from"".You remember the tragic saga: after four decades of frolicking with the kids, starring in Moomba and on ankle-biter television, Zig and Zag were finally made Moomba monarchs in 1999 but the reign was over before it began. Suddenly it was revealed that, years before, Zig had pleaded guilty to child molestation and he (and, hence, hapless Zag) was dethroned. Zig and Zag never spoke to each other again.

"Mark, I am sorry for your desperation (I'll refrain from skepticism), but it is both misguided and misplaced. The issue is far wider than a dialog with ""pro-Moldovan"" interests. It is a a dialog with Russo-skeptic interests—and since Mauco has branded me a partisan, I'll identify that as my ""partisanship."" I do not see this as an ethnic struggle for self-determination of Ukranians and Russians from Moldovans. I see it as a naked Russian power play (and not the only such one currently) to gain economic advantage and energy advantage it can use as a lever and territorial buffer advantage against NATO expansion. Regarding the will of the people and dancing with joy in the streets, no impartial observer—and certainly no Russo-skeptic—will regard those as true expressions until such time as, minimally: the authorities, from the top to the bottom, are replaced with Transnistrian natives, not populated by Russian citizens including OMON thugs who transplanted to Transnistria once their attempts at thwarting true democracy in the Baltics by violent and deadly means failed, and Russia (and Ukranian) forces completely vacate the Transnistrian territory, that is all arms, all troops, and raze all arms depots to the ground.When that happens, and people then dance in the streets, then I will be prepared to initiate a discussion with you about that expression being genuine.   You keep talking about the parliament's ""opposition"" to Smirnov. As a Russo-skeptic, I will tell you that my interpretation is not popular representation in action, my interpretation is a bunch of initially hastily organized parties which all suddenly appeared right before some ""elections"" which are now engaged with the leadership—which has not changed since its inception—in a carefully orchestrated ballet intended to present a fully believable facsimile of representative government. We can seriously discuss the will of the people:after every Russian in the PMR authorities is out (as in out, and out of the country);after the foreign troops are all out (as in out of the country, and their arms depots demolished)and I don't mean Russian military retiring to become ""citizens of the PMR,"" either;after it is legal for a political party to be pro-Moldovan (that currently being treason); andafter Romanian is once again taught in its proper Latin script, not in some Cyrillic Soviet-era utter bastardization created purely to support the Stalinist fiction that Moldovans are not Romanians.Then we can seriously discuss the validity of your interpretation. I have the patience to wait for that discussion, do you?   If the ""Russo-skeptics"" disagree with anything I've represented, please feel free to correct. — "	0|0|0|0|0|0

"Firstly, I am not fixated on, nor am I carrying on a dispute with, Epeefleche, and I certainly have no desire to get into any conflict with them. If you are not prepared to accept that then my posting any further unblock request would be pointless.For what it's worth, my attention was drawn to the article in question by additions made by Epeefleche to several golfer biographies which are on my watchlist. I first posted a message on Epeefleche's talk page explaining the minor changes I had made to those additions to those articles to try and negate any potential for conflict. I also explained the obvious issue I had noticed with the inclusion criteria for that list, before posting on the article talk page. I do not think either of those edits were disruptive or confrontational in any way, and thought I had responded in a reasonable manner to all Epeefleche's comments, while trying to return the focus onto the article. I repeat, I do not wish to engage in any dispute or conflict with Epeefleche or any other contributor and that remains the case. I cannot be any clearer on that.I have acknowledged that I should not have engaged in repeated reverting, and I see how that could potentially inflame things even more than usual in this instance.Yes, my response to Greg L was over the top and I should have done as I usually do – don't click the save page button and just ignore it, but it's too late now. bigissue "	0|0|0|0|0|0

Well done, fucking well done, you are so pig-shit thick and lazy rather than 1. do a little bit of work and find some sources yourself, you just delete stuff because it takes less effort, or 2. assume good faith. Most people don't make stuff up that they add. If you had one iota of sense in that pig-shit brain of yours, you would at least do a quick internet search to check the facts before having a WP:OWN fap and then deleting anything that you like. Personally I think, and I have said this before, you make absolutely no positive contributions to this site. Just looking at your edit log clearly shows you generate nothing or even bother to write something = er this is an encyclopedia. If you had your way, it would be whittled down to nothing. You have got talent or knowledge except self-importance because it's easier to be a fucking Rules Lawyer than an editor. I have nothing but the utter contempt for you because you cannot even do the most simplest of things and look up something.

It was used to illustrate a particular point in a discussion in a particular article and was not supposed to last long.  I intentionally left off the copyright info so that the image would be removed.  Please feel free to do so right away, and I am sorry for the bother that this might have caused you.

"Your accustations towards ArcAngelYour comment here: User_talk:ArcAngel#Sockpuppetry.3F is a bit of bad faith in my view. If you have no proof, don't go around accusing people of having sockpuppets. And the comment of ""I am watching you"" seems to be another way of saying you are stalking the editor. That's unacceptable, and you will be reported if you don't stop this harassing behaviour.

" Edit summary When editing an article on Wikipedia there is a small field labelled ""Edit summary"" under the main edit-box. It looks like this:The text written here will appear on the Recent changes page, in the page revision history, on the diff page, and in the watchlists of users who are watching that article. See m:Help:Edit summary for full information on this feature.When you leave the edit summary blank, some of your edits could be mistaken for vandalism and may be reverted, so please always briefly summarize your edits, especially when you are making subtle but important changes, like changing dates or numbers. Thank you.  I do, when I'm doing anything more than grammar. The only exception to this would be on Clan Fraser of Lovat, of which I'm the only editor at present, and I didn't think to add edit summaries. Otherwise, I believe that I have done so. If you have any particular situations in which I have failed to do so, I'd be happy to explain myself; I'd much appreciate it.  See it for yourself: Green bars are for edit summaries, red bars are for edits with no summaries.  That's quite a nifty tool there. I'm fully aware of edit summaries. I don't provide edit summaries on my own talk page, or my User Page. I also don't usually provide them on other users' talk pages. In earlier editing, I didn't take the summary seriously; if you're referring to anything from several months ago or more, I do apologize. Like I said: if you have any particular situations where you believe I missed one, please bring them up to me. I would sincerely like to know. Otherwise, I don't see what you're trying to accomplish here.  I think the link speaks for itself.  As for what I'm trying to accomplish, I think my original comment explained just that.  If you were trying to just helpfully remind me, I thank you, though I don't think it was needed. I saw the page; it didn't say anything to me, except that I finally know my edit count. If you really want to get a point across to me, I suggest you do so blatantly. If your original comment explained your motives, then we are done here.   Your ""nonsense"" page If you are interested in archiving your old talk, you may want to review Wikipedia:How to archive a talk page.  Accusing other editors of ""defacing"" your talk page for politely reminding you of Wikipedia policies against personal attacks does not demonstrate good faith on your part, and will only make you look bad.  I suggest you move the archive to a more appropriate name like User talk:Canaen/archive1.  Furthermore, making negative comments about discussion by other editors, and claiming that their edits ""are not worth reading"" shows that you aren't interested in abiding by  WP:NPA, WP:CIV, nor WP:EQ.  If you want to improve your working relationship with other editors, it might help to avoid incivility.  I'm not interested in archiving my old talk as of yet, but thank you for the suggestion. I use ""nonsense"" in a lot of ways other people do not, because I find a lot of other words to be boring at present. Likewise,  instead of ""cool,"" or ""awesome,"" or ""that's interesting,"" I'm currently in the habit of referring to things as ""nifty."" It's something I do. I know how to archive a talk page, I've done it before. I still do not consider suggesting ignorance to be a personal attack, because I've grown up in a rather intellectual atmosphere. I'm not going to change just because a few people are offended at my words. I thought that this was resolved by now. I have quite decent relationships with other working editors; it seems that a particular user and myself simply do not get along. It is regretful, but something which seems to be. If someone takes offence to my creation of a Nonsense page, they can bring it up to me personally, as you	0|0|0|0|0|0

I disagree.  Nobody has yet made a case against the inclusion of statistical data when it’s used in support of a discussion about causal theories, which in this case it would be.I recommend that people take a look at how this issue is handled by other, similar Wikipedia articles, particularly Race and intelligence, which has been at least as hotly contested as this one.  Although the focus of that article is on the various explanations that have been proposed for this IQ difference, the IQ difference itself is considered central enough to the article that it’s represented visually in this chart.  This image used to be part of the article also—it was eventually removed because editors decided that it was original research, but nobody there had a problem with the idea of this data being depicted with an image.The original research claim obviously doesn’t apply to an image from the DOJ website, and I think all of the same principles that apply to race and intelligence apply here also.  The only question that needs to be considered is whether the data represented in the image is relevant to the article, which in this case it clearly is.	0|0|0|0|0|0

"No worries here against re-adding it—I understand where you're coming from. I suppose it's more-or-less common sense to me that it's impossible to give someone a ""warning to stop"" vandalism if they are not ""active now"" with vandalism. To give somebody a warning for example to ""stop eating"" makes little sense if they are not currently eating. Thus, the so-called ""warning"" is not actually a warning at all because there is no logic to hold it together. Just now however I realize that this is probably quite beyond 'common' sense so I would have no issue if you re-add that bit.  · talk "	0|0|0|0|0|0

"As far as I can tell, learned people don't express their opinions as either ""Vatican II is infallible"" or ""Vatican II is not infallible"".  Everyone is pretty much agreed that ecumenical councils exercise their infallibility via the promulgation of dogmatic definitions, so the question really is whether Vatican II promulgated any dogmatic definitions.  Even the famous Pope Paul VI quote that traditional Catholics always cite uses this terminology:“There are those who ask what authority, what theological qualification, the Council intended to give to its teachings, knowing that it avoided issuing solemn dogmatic definitions backed by the Church's infallible teaching authority. The answer is known by those who remember the conciliar declaration of March 6, 1964, repeated on November 16, 1964. In view of the pastoral nature of the Council, it avoided proclaiming in an extraordinary manner any dogmas carrying the mark of infallibility.” (General Audience, December 1, 1966, published in the L'Osservatore Romano 1/21/1966)   "	0|0|0|0|0|0

states Courts: I have been putting all articles dealing with state law and state courts and their judges under the 'foo law' sub-category for each US 'foo' state.  This at least puts everything involving law and its administration in one place.  While the courts are of course part of 'government', in some states their articles were so dominating the government category, that the executive and legislative articles were losing out.  I can certainly see putting a 'see also' notice at the top of each 'government of foo' category to point to the 'foo law' category. Communications: Communications, of course, encompasses media, and also telephone (area codes) and mail (zip codes) and internet, etc.  I see no differenece to be made at the US level versus the state level.  Not sure that media is of such overwhelming importance at the state level, however, that it needs to be in multiple places or at the state level. Thanks	0|0|0|0|0|0
